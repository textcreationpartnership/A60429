         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOW concerning our dear Friend and Brother <hi>Humphry Smith,</hi> who formerly had been a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and a Man of Note; but when it pleaſed the Lord to call him by his Grace, and reveal his Son in him, he came to be an able Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and freely did preach the Goſpel, as he had received it freely; and was caſt in Priſon for the Teſtimony of Jeſus at <hi>Everſham</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> where he ſuffered very much in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s days, about the year 1655. and beſides, ſeveral other Goals, that it may be party ſaid of him, as it was of <hi>Paul,</hi> who had been zealous among the Letter-Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and who had then eſteem of him; but when he came to poſſeſs Chriſt Jeſus, and to preach him, then they hated him and perſecuted him. Yet through the Eternal Power of the Lord, he was upholden through his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and travelled through many Hardſhips for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, and did convert and turn
<pb facs="tcp:66375:3"/> many to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that had been outward Profeſſors, as he himſelf had been, to the Poſſeſſion of Chriſt; ſo that he did ſee and was comforted in the Fruits of his Labours in Chriſt and his Grace. And at laſt he was caſt into <hi>Wincheſter-Goal,</hi> where he ended his days and finiſht his Teſtimony in an hard Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who there dyed in the Lord, and reſts from his Labour, whoſe Works follow him: Whoſe Memorial is bleſt among the Righteous in the Lords Heritage; for he was a worthy Souldier and Follower of the Lamb, and kept his Habitation in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom he now ſleeps.</p>

            <p>ALthough I have not read all the Books and Writings given forth in Truths behalf by our dear Friend and Brother <hi>Humphry Smith,</hi> and therefore cannot knowingly give particular account thereof, as to all his Writings, though many ſound and weighty Experimental things I am ſure he has written, yet from the knowledge which I had of him, his Converſation and Teſtimony, and the living Society I had with him for ſome time before his Courſe was finiſhed, I have this Teſtimony nakedly and in the ſight of the Lord to bear, That he was a man fearing God and hating Iniquity, fervent and zealous againſt Deceit and Hypocriſie, and endued with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gift and Goſpel Teſtimony, which he faithfully bore in his day, according to his Ability, and the Lord was with him, and he was well beloved among his People. He endured the Croſs, and bore Afflictions patiently; and he was a great Sufferer in divers Goals and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his
<pb facs="tcp:66375:4"/> Teſtimony which he declin'd not. And he was (in the Name of the Lord) inſtrumental and helpful with other faithful Brethren and Servants of Chriſt, to break through rough Oppoſitions, perverſe Gain-ſayings and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of many Adverſaries to the Life of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> even in thoſe days of great Hardſhips and deep Sufferings, not long after the firſt breaking forth of the Goſpel Day to many in this Age; and in divers parts of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Nation, the Exerciſes, deep Sufferings and Tryals of that day and time, many now have not known the ſharpneſs of, ſince which the Lord has been with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants all along, and proſpered his Work among the ſincere Receivers of his Truth in the love thereof; and the Lord our God hath crowned the Labours of his faithful Witneſſes, whoſe Dayes are ended in Peace, among whom this Honeſt and Upright hearted man <hi>Humphry Smith</hi> had his Share and Portion, and hath his Crown that fades not, and his Inheritance Everlaſting, in the Kingdom of his and our Heavenly Father, among the Spirits of Juſt Men in Glory, I am really ſatisfied, as knowing the End of the Upright Man to be Peace, and that in the ſight of the Lord the Death of his Saints are Precious, as their Life is Acceptible: And I pray God that all Friends, and all thoſe that yet remain with a Teſtimony for him and his holy Truth, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in (and with tender Regard unto) the ſame Footſteps of the faithful and bleſſed Flock to the end of their Dayes, as thoſe that truly have reſpect to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward and Kingdom that's ſet before, which will remain and ſtand us in ſtead when our Dayes, Times and Years here are expired and gone.</p>

            <p>ARE thy famous Works ever to be forgotten? Are thy Noble and Valiant Acts to be blotted out of the Memory of the Righteous? Is thy holy, innocent pure Life to be buried in Oblivion, as not to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by us any more? Are thy Sufferings, with all thy valiant Engagements with the Enemies of thy God to be blotted out of the Record of the Children of the moſt High? Oh! what ſaith my Soul? Nay, nay, let it be had in living Remembrance among the Followers of the Lamb, and let it be written upon the Tables of their Hearts, even to all Generations.</p>
            <p>And as concerning this man, he from his Youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had deſires after the Lord, and he was often check'd by his Father becauſe of his Solidity; he mourned
<pb facs="tcp:66375:5"/> mightily after the Lord while he was yet a Child, yea, and panted after the God that made him: He followed the zealous Profeſſors, and encreaſed mightily in that Knowledge which ſtands in the Comprehenſion, yea, exceeded many of his equals; but at laſt the Lord ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for his own glory, and ſent him forth in his own Power and Eternal Name, ſo he led him by the hand through the Wilderneſs, and bore up his head above the Waves which ſought to deſtroy him; he became a Talk and a By-word unto them with whom (before) he had his Converſation; yea, they ſought to deſtroy him in a moment, but yet the Lord led him in the way, and gave him the threſhing Inſtrument that belongs to Worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> deſpiſed of men, and he threſhed and beat the Hills to Duſt, and rooted up the Diſobedient that deſiſted Gods coming; he ſpared not, but cut on the right hand, and ſlew on the left, and made the Arrows of his Quiver to ſtrike into the Bowels of Gods Enemies; but the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Peace to the Captive, and uttered his Voice to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of Hope, which lay groaning for Deliverance; he was ſent to publiſh Salvation, and to cry the acceptible year of Redemption, though the Rulers of the Earth dealt very hardly with him, and the Prieſts cryed, <hi>Away with him, he is not worthy to live;</hi> the Profeſſors envied him becauſe of his upright dealing; and the Prophane hated and reviled him becauſe of his Innocent Life; he was often times caſt into ſeveral naſty Priſons; he was divers times whipt with Cords; he was haled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Magiſtrates that had no pity nor compaſſion of him; he divers times ventured upon hard ſervice, and broke through an Hoſt of Wicked and Unreaſonable men; the Prieſts fell before him like Tow, and the Profeſſors were ſcattered like Chaff, the Wicked and Prophane were even
<pb facs="tcp:66375:5"/> confounded and amazed when his Arrows ſo ſharp did enter within their dark Dwellings; but to the Seed he uttered his Voice, and it dropped like Wax into the Bowels of the tender hearted: Verily the conſideration thereof doth even melt my heart, and makes me to ſay, <hi>Oh! how delightſom was the pleaſantneſs of thy Beauty! and how deſireable was the habitation of thy Dwelling? and how prevalent were thy Prayers, and thy Supplications with thy God? who anſwered thee every Morning, and ſatisfied thy Soul every Moment, which made thy Cup to overflow, and the pleaſant Streams to run over its Banks, becauſe of the fullneſs thereof; and Wo to him that lifts up a Tongue againſt thee, and let him not be reckoned among the Congregations of the Righteous, that ſlanders thy Innocent Life, let him be ſmitten with Terror that whiſper's or ſpeaks Evil of thee in a Corner; for I know the Lord loved thee, and hath taken thee from the Evil that is to come upon the Inhabitants of the Earth, and out of this dark World that is not worthy of thee.</hi>
            </p>

<pb facs="tcp:66375:6"/> cloſe Priſon at <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> but to leave them without excuſe in the day of the Lord, which haſtens to come upon them, he wrote unto them, ſignifying how illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had dealt with him; alſo ſent them back an Anſwer to that which they charged againſt him, likewiſe ſhewing that they laid nothing to his charge but what was charged againſt Gods Servants in the dayes of old, and moreover proved unto them, that they had acted contrary to the <hi>King's Laws, Declaration</hi> and <hi>Word;</hi> yet though all this and much more might be written, both of his Uſage in the Priſon, and likewiſe how cloſe a Hole it was, ſometimes other Priſoners, Fellons or ſuch taking his Food from him, and other Abuſes which he bore very patiently, which will be too tedious at preſent to relate; and likewiſe <hi>John Norton</hi> and <hi>Humphry Bennet</hi> ſending men and robbing him of all his Papers, rifling his Pockets, Boxes and other places, yet he was very quiet, and lay down content; but the next approaching Seſſions being come, he laid ſomething of his ſuffering Cauſe before ſome of thoſe called Juſtices, and at that time ſome of them were willing to have releaſed him, but ſome others of them being contrary minded, ſaying, <hi>That it was the Deputy-Lievetenants of the Shire that committed him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not there they would not meddle with the thing:</hi> So the innocent Sufferer was let continue a Priſoner till the next Aſſizes, and he then laid the thing before Judge <hi>Terril,</hi> who before had been pretty moderate to Friends, and the Judge gave him this anſwer, <hi>That if he would give Bail for his good Behaviour and Appearance at the next Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes</hi> (though no evil Behaviour at all was laid to his charge) which when this innocent Sufferer heard, and being ſatisfied that he was not guilty of the Breach of any Law, neither was there any that laid any thing to his
<pb facs="tcp:66375:6"/> charge, he was content to remain there, rather than to do ſuch a thing; and ſo remaining there from Seſſions till Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes, and from Aſſizes till Seſſions, and until that Aſſizes a whole year was over; then Judge <hi>Terril</hi> came again the Weſtern Circute, which <hi>Humphry Smith</hi> hearing of, wrote unto him, ſignifying how contrary to any known Law he had been dealt with, and requiring Juſtice, and that true Judgment might proceed from him, and leaving him without excuſe he ſent it to him, which he underſtood he read, and about the latter end of the Aſſizes he was call'd for, where having divers words with the Judge, he again ſaid, <hi>That if he would give Bail for his good Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Appearance at the next Aſſizes, he ſhould be releaſed;</hi> which he anſwered thus, That he had lain in Priſon ſo long, and nothing of evil Behaviour laid to his charge; and likewiſe ſaying that if any man there ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of any evil Behaviour, he ſhould willingly acknowledge the ſame, unto which they were all ſilent; then the Judge ſaid, <hi>If he would meet no more, and promiſe not to break the Law, he ſhould be releaſed;</hi> unto which he anſwered thus, I think it is ſufficient that I ſuffer if I do break the Law, and not to ſuffer becauſe I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not to break it, ſaying alſo, That he knew no Law that required any ſuch thing; ſo it being near the time of their breaking up, he was put aſide, and others called, and ſoon after they diſmiſſed the Court for that Aſſizes at that Bench; but as the Judge was paſſing forth, <hi>Humphry Smith</hi> being at the Bar among the Fellons, he ſpake theſe words unto him, <hi>Friend, remember I have been above a whole year in Priſon, and no breach of any Law proved againſt me;</hi> which the Judge heard, but paſſed away and ſaid nothing to it. So he was had back to Priſon again, where having been not above three weeks, but he fell ſick,
<pb facs="tcp:66375:7"/> firſt it took him like an Ague, and afterward with the Feaver following it, and in a ſhort time it grew very violent upon him, inſomuch that in five days time he was ſo weak that he could ſcarcely help himſelf, then he alſo ſent a Letter unto Judge <hi>Terril,</hi> ſignifying his Illegal dealing with him, and alſo gave him to know, that he was very Ill, but there was little done in the thing; ſo he grew weaker and weaker, ſo that two men did turn him in his Bed; and in the time of his Sickneſs he ſpake ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words to Friends, ſignifying unto them, <hi>That he was given up in the will of the Lord, either in Life or Death;</hi> and as he lay under a great ſit of the Feaver, he ſaid; <hi>My heart is filled with the Power of God;</hi> and then ſaid, <hi>It is good for a man at ſuch a time as this to have the Lord to be his Friend;</hi> Another time he ſaid, <hi>Lord, thou ſentſt me forth to do thy Will, and I have been faithful unto thee in my ſmall meaſure which thou haſt committed unto me; but if thou wilt yet try me further, thy will be done:</hi> Alſo, he ſaid, <hi>I am the Lords, let him do what he will.</hi> And near the time of his departure, he cryed earneſtly unto the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>O Lord! hear the inward Sighs and Groans of thine Oppreſſed, and deliver my poor Soul from the Oppreſſor: O Lord, hear me! O Lord, uphold and preſerve me; (I know that my Redeemer liveth) Thou art ſtrong and mighty, O Lord!</hi> with ſeveral other precious words. Alſo, about the ſame time he prayed unto the Lord, <hi>That he would deliver his People from their cruel Oppreſſors; and that thoſe that were convinced or brought forth by him, that the Lord would be their Teacher.</hi> He lay very quiet and ſtill, and not any unſavoury word proceeded out of his Mouth all the time of his Sickneſs, but he behaved himſelf like a Lamb, and he was very ſenſible unto the laſt Moment; he was faithful unto the Lord in his day, and a Crown
<pb facs="tcp:66375:7"/> Everlaſting is upon his head, which ſhall reſt upon him when all his Oppreſſors ſhall gnaſh their Tongues for pain and vexation of Heart (as ſome of them have felt already) yea, and the full Cup of the Lords Indignation is preparing for all them who delight in Cruelty: He was very meek, and of a quiet Spirit, very loving to all that had the leaſt appearance of the Light ſpringing up in them; yea, if any knew not the Light which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the ſin, then in the Meekneſs of the Love ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, he would open unto them the way thereunto, and labour mightily to bring them to the knowledge of it: Oh! how great was his love to the eternal Truth, which abounded in his heart! and how would he groan for the loſt Sheep! ſurely his Love was more than my Tongue can expreſs; and his Courage did abound in a great meaſure; he delighted not in vain Janglings nor Diſputings of men of Corrupt Minds, but in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel of Peace, which is his Crown forever and ever. What ſhall I ſay? his Life is ſwallowed up in Immortality, and is no more to be ſeen in the viſible, yet he reigns over all Whiſperers, Back-biters and Slanderers of his innocent Life forever.</p>
            <p>Thou Renowned Judge in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thou Valiant Souldier of the Lambs Hoſt, Peace is thy Portion forever, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings will fill thine Houſe, and Fruitfulneſs will attend thy Seed, as they abide in the Counſel of him who was the Biſhop of thy Soul.</p>

Not long after he was caſt into this Priſon, ſome of
<pb facs="tcp:66375:11"/> thoſe that were convinced by his Teſtimony, that had a love raiſed to the Lord, and ſome knowledge of his Way and Truth; ſome of theſe in <hi>Andever</hi> being thereby led forth to viſit <hi>Humphry</hi> in Priſon, both Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors began to ſtir, and be in a rage againſt; and at the breaking forth of Truth in that Town, I then being weary of Prieſts and ſeperate Profeſſors, ſeeing their Pride, Avarice, Evil Lives and Converſations, though under a ſpecious pretence of God and Godlineſs, but void of the ſaving knowledge of both; I being ſenſible that this was my Condition, and finding and feeling the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, and the weight and burden of Sin and Iniquity, (being in the bondage of Corruption, like them I had been among) under all groaned to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from under the weight and burden thereof, into the glorious Liberty and Freedom of the Sons and Daughters of God; and being unacquainted with the Way of the Lord, or how to do his Will, or to have any entrance into the Kingdom that conſiſts in Righteouſneſs, Joy and Peace in the holy Ghoſt, which the Prieſts and Profeſſors could not teach, but were almoſt as ignorant as thoſe that in time paſt had not heard of any ſuch thing, and void of the ſaving knowledge of Jeſus, the way of God, and could not ſay, that he was the Chriſt by it; I then hearing that in this Priſon was that faithful Servant of the Lord, and having longing deſire to ſee him, went with ſome of <hi>Andever</hi> that uſed to viſit him, there being that day a Meeting in the Priſon, which day I hope ſhall never be forgotten (by me) nor that faithful and able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the new Teſtament, knowing that which only and alone is made alive by the Spirit, and quickned and reached unto by the Miniſters thereof, which <hi>Humphry Smith</hi> was one, to the turning of many from Darkneſs

                  <hi>And now although, as I ſaid before, thou art my only Son, yet if thou refuſest the Inſtructions of thy Father, and ſhalt reject the Counſel of God, and not walk in Gods holy fear, nor keep in the way of Truth, then let the Judgment of Friends paſs upon thee, let the Law of God ſeize upon thy Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt time I ſaw him was about a year before he dyed, at which time he gave me ſuch Advice and Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as thereby I perceived I ſhould never ſee him again; ſo great a ſight of things and men had he, that I may truly ſay, he had the neceſſary Gift of <hi>Diſcerning of Spirits,</hi> with frequent Viſions and Revelations from God, by which he foreſaw and propheſied of many things, ſome whereof he ſaw fulfilled, others are ſince, and the reſt will certainly be fulfilled in their appointed time; ſome of them are herein extant, diſperſed among his Works, which are now printed for thy benefit (<hi>ſober Reader</hi>) it being agreeable to words he wrote to me in a Volumn of Books he cauſed to be bound for me, <q>
                  <hi>That I ſhould keep that Book ſafe, and not ſpoiled any way, that in years to come, Ages may read and ſee my love to the Seed.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This in ſhort I have written concerning him, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there be many ſtill living, who have a larger Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in themſelves concerning him. And ſome who were his <hi>Fellow-Labourers in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> whom he
<pb facs="tcp:66375:13"/> did (and I do) <hi>love, and in Honour Prefer, counting them worthy of double Honour,</hi> ſome of them having more knowledge of him, are able, as they ſee meet, to give a larger Teſtimony concerning him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude, deſiring that my ſelf, and all the Children of faithful Parents, may walk in the good Way they walked in, and not like that Generation mentioned, <hi>Judges 2. 10. Who aroſe after the Death of</hi> Joſhua <hi>and the Elders, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the Works which he had done for Iſrael;</hi> but that we may follow the Lord fully and faithfully, and he may raiſe up in us the ſame Love, Zeal, Diligence and Vallour, as he did in our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is the earneſt Deſire of</p>

            <head>THE Sufferings, Tryals &amp; Purgings Of the <hi>SAINTS</hi> at EVESHAM; Who by their Obedience to the Lord in their Meaſures, do overcome their Enemies, by their daily ſuffering under them.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or,</hi> A ſhort Deſcription of the firſt Ground of the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of the Servants of God, occaſioned by the Prieſts, and the continual Proceedings of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates againſt them called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS the Prieſts were always Enemies unto Chriſt and his Diſciples, ſo do they continue perſecuting the Saints, <hi>laying Snares for the Innocent, and ſmiting with the Tongue, Jer.</hi> 18. 18. and ſtirring up the Rulers and the rude Multitude, making Uproars and Inſurrections againſt the Saints, as they did againſt Chriſt and his Miniſters; for <hi>the chief Prieſts, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Scribes and Elders of the People, conſulted how they might take Jeſus by ſubtilty and kill him; yet they would not do it on the Feaſt day, leſt there ſhould be an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>proar among the People,</hi> Mat. 26. 3, 4, 5 But the chief Prieſt and Rulers in <hi>Eveſham,</hi> after their Conſultations (how to enſnare the Innocent) did come on the firſt day to enſnare us, but (ſtanding in the counſel of God) we were preſerved from their firſt Snare which they laid for us (I having notice of it before) in bringing the whole multitude to provoke or entrap us; the which when they could not do, though hundreds of them gathered together about the Door,
<pb facs="tcp:66375:18"/> (where I and many of the Servants of the Lord were) like thoſe that gathered together about <hi>Lot</hi>'s door, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 4, 5. yet none of them could provoke us to words, nor had they any way to enſnare us then, as afterwards will appear.</p>
            <p>And after the chief Prieſts had hired <hi>Judas</hi> for thirty pieces of Silver to betray Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 15. and after <hi>Judas</hi> had brought again the thirty pieces of Silver, then the chief Prieſts took the ſame Money for the which <hi>Judas</hi> had ſold Chriſt, and with it they bought a field of Blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 6, 7, 8. So the chief Prieſts have purchaſed (unto themſelves and all their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration) with the price of Blood a field a Blood, to bury all thoſe that are ſtrangers to the Covenant of Grace: So <hi>Gog,</hi> who makes War with the Saints, hath a place of Graves in <hi>Iſrael, Ezek</hi> 39. 11. &amp; ver. 19, 20. and the dead are burying the dead; for both Prieſts and People are prophane and dead in Treſpaſſes and in Sins, their hands being guilty of the Blood of the Righteous. And after Chriſt was betrayed by the means of the Prieſts, (and when <hi>Pilate,</hi> who would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him) they taught the People to ask for a Murderer, and and deſtroy Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 20. (and ſuch teachings the Prieſts do uſe now) And after Jeſus was by their means crucified, and after he was riſen, then they conſulted again with the Elders; and they gave large Money unto the Souldiers to tell Lyes, and taught them ſo to do, that their murdering Actions might be hid, and the Diſciples falſly accuſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 11, 12, 13. And <hi>the Servant is not greater than his Maſter, whom they have called</hi> Belzebub, <hi>much more them of his Houſhold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the chief Prieſts have conſulted againſt, and crucified Chriſt, and denyed him in the Reſurrection, ſo they ſtill continue perſecuting and conſulting againſt his Members, harmleſs Lambs and faithful Miniſters; and there is little Perſecution in <hi>England</hi> but the Prieſts have a hand in it, if not the firſt Actors of it, as thou <hi>George Hopkins</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Eveſham</hi> hadſt in all the barbarous Perſecution there; for after I and other Friends kept Meetings in private at <hi>Bengard</hi> in this Burrough of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> and none did make Inſurrections againſt us, neither did we give offence to any, therefore thou couldſt not find any ground at all to enſnare us by. Then upon the 19th day of the 6th Moneth,
<pb facs="tcp:66375:18"/> 1655. on that day didſt thou with the Magiſtrates, and the reſt, ſeek to enſnare us, it being the Firſt day of the Week, and I being at <hi>Bengard,</hi> at an appointed Meeting, and thou being in thine accuſtomed Steeple-houſe in <hi>Eveſham,</hi> both parts of the day, as thy cuſtom was; and after thou hadſt done, according to thy cuſtom, then thou and the reſt came from that Steeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to the Steeple-houſe in <hi>Bengard,</hi> and with thee didſt thou bring the whole Congregation, both the called Juſtices and Magiſtrates, and rude People ſeveral hundreds, the like ſeldom heard of. And that thou cameſt on purpoſe to entrap us and ſtir up Perſecution, and ſmite with the Tongue, will appear by theſe things following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> Thou waſt not uſe to come to that Steeple-houſe, neither didſt thou come there in the like manner before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> In thy coming that day on which I was there; for I was there but ſeldom upon Firſt days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> In that thou hadſt thy Congregation with thee in thy Steeple-houſe at <hi>Eveſham,</hi> where thou mightſt have ſaid any thing to them then and there, as well as to bring the ſame Congregation to another Steeple-houſe to hear the ſame man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> There were no People in <hi>Bengard,</hi> but did or might come to hear thee in thy accuſtomed place, as they were uſed to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly,</hi> In that thou haſt not been in that Steeple-houſe ſince that day, it being now fifteen weeks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly,</hi> In that when thou waſt come there, thou didſt ſpeak evil of things thou didſt not know, and back-bite others. And thoſe thou didſt bring with thee, even this one Congregation, to them diſtſt thou ſay, <hi>O fooliſh</hi> Galatians! <hi>who hath bewitched you that you ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi> And I ſay unto thee, if thou hadſt not bewitched them, they would not have obey'd thee (but the Truth) to come there to hear thy Lyes; for many there thou didſt declare, as to thy face was proved by <hi>Robert Smith,</hi> for the which he was impriſoned eleaven weeks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7thly,</hi> It will appear by thy Sorcery which thou didſt then vent forth, making that thy ground in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. thy heads thereof in ſhort (as it was brought to me in writing, witneſſed by many, and not denyed, but confeſſed with thy own Mouth ſince to me)

And when we were firſt brought into the Houſe then <hi>John Nickles,</hi> one of the Conſtables, ſmote <hi>Thomas Cartrite</hi> on the head, and the Juſtices ſtood by and cared not for it; and afterwards our Hats were taken off our heads, and thrown among the feet of the People: Then they asked me <hi>from whence I came?</hi> I anſwered, from <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Then there was a Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among them, both Prieſt, Juſtices and People; <hi>for the Fools
<pb facs="tcp:66375:19"/> heart is full of Laughter.</hi> And after they had continued ſo, I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak to them thus; <hi>O People! is there no fear of God before your Eyes? Did ever the Saints of Chriſt live in Laughing, Mocking and Wantonneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Prieſt, to uphold them in it, ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Elijah <hi>did Mock</hi> Baals <hi>Prieſts.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though he did ſo, yet it is not convenient to bring that Scripture to juſtifie the People in Mocking.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Theophilus Andrus</hi> ſaid, <hi>He hath ſpoken enough already; what need we have any further witneſs? Therefore make him a Paſs to go to</hi> Aegypt <hi>again, and let him be whipt out of the Town; for there is an Act of Parliament againſt ſuch as wander up and down under the Name of</hi> Aegyptians.</p>
            <p>Then ſome asked, <hi>When I came from thence?</hi> others mocked. So I was a ſport unto them, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was unto the <hi>Philiſtians, Judg.</hi> 16. 25. and I ſtood ſilent; but at laſt the Lord moved me to ſpeak, ſaying, Why People are you altogether blind in the things of God? Of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi> I was, where our Lord was crucified, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8. and in Darkneſs and Bondage did I dwell, being a Child of Wrath as well as others; but the Lord by his living Power hath brought me from the Land of Darkneſs to the Light, and from Bondage to the Land of Reſt, and into the Liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Theophilus Andrus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Speak on, for I never heard the like of this before.</hi> But I was not to be ſubject to their Wills, but to ſtand in the counſel of God.</p>
            <p>Queſtion; <hi>But you have had ſome outward Beeing or Family, had you not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer;</hi> I had a Farme of 30 <hi>l.</hi> by the year, at <hi>little Cowrne,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> not thirty Miles off this place; but I have now left part of it, and my Wife and Children are in the reſt; and there I was a great Profeſſor and a publick Preacher in many places thereabout daily, and then I was owned by the Juſtices and great men of the Earth, and many Hundreds did reſort to hear me, where I came, and I was then beloved of many; for the World loves his own. But now I come to witneſs the Power of that which then I did but profeſs, and now am I hated by the World. And after other words from them called Juſtices,
<pb facs="tcp:66375:20"/> and others, and they could not entangle me in my words, then the Prieſt with the ſubtilty of the Serpent, ſeeing they could not enſnare me, he then began, like thoſe that came to Chriſt and feigned themſelves juſt men, that they might take hold of his words, and deliver him to the Power, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 20. And like as the Saduces came to entangle him concerning the Reſurrection, ſaying, <hi>Moſes ſaith thus, but what ſayeſt thou?</hi> So the Prieſt <hi>George Hopkins,</hi> among his many ſubtil Queſtions, ſaid, <hi>Thus</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith, The juſt man falleth ſeven times; What ſay you?</hi> or the like. <hi>And there is not a man upon Earth that doth good and ſinneth not: How do you expound that?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I am redeemed from the Earth.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But do you not walk on the Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I walk in the Light, which leads out of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are you not upon the Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As for this outward Body being upon the Earth, <hi>Enoch</hi> was for a time upon this outward Earth, yet he walked with God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But do you walk with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They that are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God, as God hath ſaid, <hi>I will walk in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith, There is not a juſt man upon Earth, that doth good and ſinneth not: Now therefore anſwer to the Queſtion, do you ſin, yea or nay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He that is born of God ſinneth not.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are you free from ſin, yea or nay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If I were not free from ſin, will it therefore follow, that no man is?</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Do you believe that any man can be free from ſin whilſt he is here?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, I do believe it.</p>
            <p>Then the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>it was a Popiſh Tenure, and he could ſhew me a Book that the</hi> Papiſts <hi>do hold, That men may be free from Sin in this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I ſaid, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do hold, that there is a God, and that Chriſt dyed for Sinners, and ſo do I: Therefore if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do hold a Truth, muſt I deny it becauſe they hold it? or muſt the Truth therefore be called a <hi>Popiſh Tenure</hi> becauſe they hold it?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66375:20"/>
            <p>The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>Nay but in ſuch things as theſe, that are in diſpute between the Papiſts and us, which is, That men may be free from Sin, and that they are juſtified by Works wrought in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwered, It is God that worketh in us, both the will and the deed, who hath wrought all our works in us and for us. And I have heard that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do hold, that there is a <hi>Purgatory</hi> (which I deny) <hi>to be purged in from Sin after Death;</hi> but I ſeldom hear that they did hold, that men might be free from ſin here. And if they are free from ſin whilſt they are here, then they need not hold, that there is a Purgatory to purge them after.</p>
            <p>Then I asked the Prieſt, if men ſhould be free from ſin whilſt they are here?</p>
            <p>The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>Nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I asked him, if men ſhould be purged from ſin after Death?</p>
            <p>The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>Nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I ſaid, if thou wilt not have men cleanſed from ſin neither before Death nor after Death, then when wilt thou have them cleanſed?</p>
            <p>The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>What if God will forgive men, and cleanſe them from their ſin at the very time of their Death, as Chriſt did the Thief on the Croſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou art not to queſtion what God will do, or may do in that; but canſt thou prove by Scripture, that God doth ſo? And if thou wilt ſay, the Thief was purged from ſin when Chriſt ſpoke to him, then that was before his death.</p>
            <p>So when the Prieſt was almoſt taken in his own Snare, then the Serpents Wiſdom began to twind out of that, and asked me <hi>How I was juſtified?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſeeing his ſubtilty, was not careful to anſwer him in that matter, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16. but ſtood ſilent, as Chriſt did before the high Prieſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 62, 63. So then there was a ſtir among the People, becauſe I was not haſty to utter words before the Lord; but after the Prieſt had urged very much, then I ſaid, Thou doſt wait to enſnare me; and if I ſhould ſay, that I was juſtified by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, thou wouldſt but ſeek to entangle me in it.</p>
            <p>Then the Prieſt asked, <hi>If I were juſtified by the Blood of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66375:21"/>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Are you juſtified by that Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed at</hi> Jeruſalem?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt (the Son of the living God, who was the expreſs Image of his Fathers glory, in whom dwelt the fullneſs of the Godhead really, who ſuffered at <hi>Mount Calvery</hi> by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for Sinners) am I juſtified.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are you juſtified by the Blood of Chriſt without you, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Though Jeſus Chriſt has ſhed his Blood for Sinners, yet I remained in my ſin until I came to witneſs the Blood of Chriſt in me.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are you not juſtified by the Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed for you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If the Blood of Chriſt was not ſhed, then Sinners could not be juſtified by it.</p>
            <p>Then the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>You do not anſwer me plainly, whether you are juſtified meerly by that Blood which was ſhed upon the Croſs, or meerly by ſomething in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> What! wouldſt thou have me ſay, that all Swearers, Lyars and Drunkards (that live and dye in their ſins) are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, becauſe Chriſt ſhed his Blood upon the Croſs?</p>
            <p>The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>Nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I ſaid, The Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed upon the Croſs I do not deny; but though he hath ſhed his Blood there for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet none come to be juſtified, or have benefit by it, as to Salvation, but thoſe that the Blood and the Life of Chriſt is raiſed up in; for they that have not the Spirit of Chriſt are none of his, and ſuch are not juſtified by him; and though he hath ſhed his Blood upon the Croſs, yet the Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God: And wouldſt thou have me ſay more, but that thou waiteſt to enſnare me?</p>
            <p>Then the Prieſt gave over that alſo, and went to entrap me in another thing, and ſaid, <hi>One of you that are called</hi> Quakers, <hi>and is a Teacher among you, did bid me give over deceiving the People, in telling them, That the Scripture is the Word of God: Now do you own the Scripture to be the Word of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Scriptures I own, and witneſs to be a true Declaration, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 1. ſpoken forth by holy men of God, as they were moved by the Spirit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and they are thoſe that teſtifie of
<pb facs="tcp:66375:21"/> Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. to be the Light of the World, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. and the Word of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 13.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are not the Scriptures the Word of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Scripture ſaith, God is the Word.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are not the Scriptures neceſſary to Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are uſeful for Doctrine, for Exhortation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are they neceſſary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are uſeful.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are they not neceſſary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are neceſſary to ſtop the Mouthes of Gain-ſayers.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are the Scriptures a neceſſary means unto Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the only means of our Salvation, and there is no other Name given under Heaven by which men ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are men ſaved without Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Now the Scriptures are written, and what is written, is written for our Learning; therefore we are not without it, but <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, <hi>Noah</hi> obeyed, and <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, before Scripture was; and they that are come unto Chriſt, are come unto that which was before Scripture was.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How did you come to know any thing but by the Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Although I had the Scripture, yet I never knew Chriſt, of whom the Scripture teſtifieth, until he was revealed in me.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Did not you come to your Knowledge at firſt, by hearing ſome Miniſter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I never profitted by any of them, but lived in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo long as I followed them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But if ye own the Scriptures to be true, and ſpoken from the Spirit of God, why will you not own it to be the Word of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Bring me any one Scripture, that ſaith, the Scripture is the Word of God, and I ſhall own it; but <hi>the Letter killeth, the Spirit giveth Life,</hi> and <hi>the Word of God is quick and powerful, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than a two edged Sword;</hi> then I took my Bible and laid it down on the Table before them, and ſaid, See, this hath no Power in it, neither can it ſtir: Then the People laught at me again; then I ſaid to them, Be ſilent for ſhame, for I ſpeak ſoberly; and this Bible is not ſharper than a two edged Sword: and if this Bible be the powerful Word of God, then the vileſt Perſon in <hi>England</hi> may buy the powerful Word of God for Four Shillings.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66375:22"/>
            <p>Thus when the Prieſt had ſought in theſe, and the like Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to enſnare me, and found no better ground; then he turned to them called Juſtices, and ſaid, <hi>Sirs, you ſee that though they deny</hi> Popery <hi>in the general, yet you ſee they hold it in the particular, as I have made it plain before you, in that he holdeth a Man may be free from Sin, and to be juſtified by Works wrought within; and if this</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery <hi>be ſuffered to creep in, then you may conceive the danger that may follow in this whole Nation; therefore I ſhall leave it unto you; and you know that I came not here until you ſent for me, therefore it is not of my procurement.</hi> So after he had betrayed me as much as he could into their Hands, like <hi>Judas,</hi> then he would have waſhed his Hands like <hi>Pilate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after I was ſent to Priſon to the Goalers Houſe, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to Swear that which afterwards they blotted out of my <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and after two dayes being at the Goalers Houſe, where the mighty Power of God appeared, to the ſilence and amazement of all the beholders, as they were amazed at the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 7. For ſeveral times after I had prayed, the People were ſhaken, and the Word of God was ſpoken with boldneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. then I was ſent to the main Goal, where the People were exceeding mad againſt me, as <hi>Saul</hi> once was againſt the Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 11. And the Rulers ſtretched forth their Hands to vex us, like <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12. 1. And the Town was moved, and the People ran together, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 30. And the Multitude, with the Magiſtrates, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 22. Being cut to the Heart, ſome gnaſhed on me with their Teeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 54. And the Multitude of the Town was divided, and there was divers aſſaults made againſt us, both of the Heathens and the Rulers, who ſought to vex us deſpightfully, as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 14 4, 5. Some threw Stones in the Priſon the wait of five pound, and threw Dirt and Water on my Lodging, and ſpit on me, and I hid not my Face from ſhame and ſpitting, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 6. And Piſt at me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and once they Piſt on my Food, and they made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Aſſaults and Inſurrections againſt our Meetings, but Friends feared none of theſe things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. but in patience endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all their bitter Perſecutions. At laſt they were aſhamed, and ſo were the <hi>Rulers,</hi> who were far worſe then the rude People; For though Friends met in the Street by the Priſon daily, yet the Meeting was not broken by the rude People, but by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
<pb facs="tcp:66375:22"/> who were at laſt more quiet, and then Friends met as peaceably in the Street, as if they had been in a private Houſe; ſo they met thrice every Week, beſides on the Market-dayes; after the Market was over, the People of the Country did come there in Peace, and receive the Word with gladneſs, and the Ignorant began to be convinced, and the Gain-ſayers Mouthes ſtopped, and much People received the Truth in love, whereby the Meetings were increaſed, and the Work of the Lord began to proſper; thus we continued for four Weeks together day by day in Peace, and then there aroſe up a new Mayor, which knew not the righteous Seed, as there aroſe up a new King in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 1. 8. And he ſaw the People of God increaſe, was vexed at it, as the world was alwayes vexed at the increaſe of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Seed; ſo that Mayor <hi>Edmond Young,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He would break our Meetings, or elſe his Bones ſhould lie in the Dirt.</hi> The which he did upon the 14th day of the 8th Moneth, being the firſt day of the Week, on the which in the Morning Friends met in private, and not in the Street, and as two Friends of the Town were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Meeting, the Mayor laid Hands on them, and put them in Priſon; and in the latter part of the day Friends met in the Street, where they uſed to do, where they were without any diſturbance, until the Mayor came with Officers, and ſaid, <hi>It was an unlawful Aſſembly;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>If there were above eight Perſons met together, it was an unlawful Aſſembly;</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently laid Hands on Friends, and pulled, and thruſt, and kickt, and put many in the Priſon and in the Stocks, and put me and two more in the Dungeon; and when he ſaw that Friends were not afraid of him, neither did any run away, then he ſaid, <hi>He wanted another Priſon for the Women</hi> (for he had impriſoned Men in four ſeveral places that time) when this was done, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Sargeant to make proclamation, and command in the Name of the Protector, <hi>That every one ſhould depart thence on pain of Impriſonment;</hi> when he wanted more Priſons to put them in. Thus he broke our Meetings, who harmed not any, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his Violence; and then he ſaid, <hi>If we would meet in Houſes or in the Fields, he would not moleſt us:</hi> Yet on the next Firſt day he ſaw one of the Town going alone to a Meeting, that we had then appointed in a Houſe, and him he put in Priſon.</p>
            <p>And ſo I being that Day put in the Dungeon, where I now am
<pb facs="tcp:66375:23"/> (as once before I was put in for Praying) then he endeavoured to keep all People from me, and for ſeveral Dayes and Nights we were denyed having Candles in this dark Dungeon; at laſt he ſent us each man a Penny-worth of Bread, and a half Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of Beer a day, the which the Goaler ſaid, was the Towns allowance; but we ſtill denyed it, and ſent him word, That if we ſhould not have Food for our Money, or from our Friends, then we ſhould be without it. So at laſt, when we could have Bread from our Friends, and Water, then we did eat and drink, and praiſe the Lord, whoſe preſence is with us.</p>
            <p>Thus he much indeavoured to bring us into ſlavery unto his corrupt will, which was according to the Words of <hi>Robert At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> that ſate Judge at the Seſſions, who then ſaid to me thus, <hi>You have been kept very high all this while; but I ſhall take a courſe e'er I go hence, that you ſhall be kept ſhorter.</hi> And the Mayor <hi>Edmond Young,</hi> cauſed a Trap-door to be made into the Dungeon, locked down, and all our Bedding and Bed-cloathes, that Friends had ſent us, to be taken from us, and will not let our Friends have it again. <hi>Joſhua Frenſham</hi> (a Priſoner) having much pain with his Teeth, did ſomething earneſtly deſire, that whilſt he was a Priſoner he might have the uſe of a Pillow that was taken away, (which was his own) but it was denyed. On the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day after we were put in the Dungeon, a Friend brought ſome Straw for us to lie on, and the Goaler would not ſuffer it to be brought into us, becauſe he would not give him Money to unlock the Doors.</p>
            <p>Once I ſent to the Mayor to have Liberty for ſome man or Friend to fetch out our Dung from us, and he denyed it, and ſent for a Conſtable to put that Friend in the Stocks that came to ask it: And before I came in the Dungeon, ſometimes our Boxes and Writings were taken from us, and ſometimes our Stools that we had to ſit or write upon, and our Candles. Beſides, eight Friends being Priſoners at the Goalers Houſe, were much abuſed by him, the which I ſhall forbear to write; only thus he ſaid unto them, <hi>If they would not pay four Pence a Night for each mans Lodging, and eight Pence a Meal for each mans Diet, then they ſhould go all to the main Goal;</hi> Which they refuſed to ſatisfie his Will in; neither were they uſed to eat of his Diet, being all Towns men: But ſometimes he would not ſuffer their Wives, nor any
<pb facs="tcp:66375:23"/> other Friend to bring their Diet to them, nor yet to come into them; Then a man gained leave of him that dwelt next the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and ſo went through his Houſe, and brought Food to the Priſoners, which when the Goaler ſaw, he threatned that man which had let him through, and took the Beer from them, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſuch Actions to force them to his will, which they would not be ſubject to; therefore he brought them all to the main Goal, and then he ſaid unto us, <hi>That if he might have his will, he would Hang us all:</hi> And he had ſaid before, <hi>He might do what he would unto us, for we ſhould have no benefit of the Law, neither durſt any Lawyer plead for us.</hi> Then were them eight kept in the Goal, and we three in the Dungeon under them, five dayes to our own Dung; as I and ſome of us have been kept in this Priſon and Dungeon, with our own Dung in the ſame Room from time to time, for this fourteen Weeks.</p>
            <p>And as for the Priſon, it is not 12 Foot ſquare; &amp; but one Goal hole belonging to it four Inches wide, where we took in our Food and Straw to lie upon, and were forced to burn Candle every day (when we have it) by reaſon the Priſon is ſo dark, and ſo cloſe, and ſo many in ſo little room, and ſo little Air, with the ſtink of our own Dung, all which might have occaſioned the Death of ſome e'er this time; and one they kept with me in the Dungeon until he had been ſick, &amp; after turned him once in the Night out; and ſome others have not been well, by reaſon of the exceeding cloſeneſs of the Priſon, whereby ſometimes the ſtink of the Priſon hath been ſo ſtrong forth in the Street, that People could not indure to ſtand by it; ſometimes when the dayes were hot, the Breath of ſome Priſoners was almoſt ſtopt, and lay for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dayes like men aſleep; and when dayes are at the coldeſt, we have not room nor place either to make Fire, or to walk to keep our Bodies warm.</p>
            <p>Yet there is a large Priſon over our Heads, where they do ſometimes impriſon many of our Friends; but that large Priſon they will not let us be in, neither could we, (nor Friends for us) prevail to have Liberty to walk in that Priſon ſometimes by day, and to come down into the other Priſon by Night.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all People (whoſe Hearts are tender towards the Lord) take notice how we are not only deprived of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Liberty (without the breach of any Law) but are alſo
<pb facs="tcp:66375:24"/> kept in a moſt barbarous condition, worſe than Thieves or Murderers, as the Goaler hath ſaid, <hi>That if we had been in for Theft or Murder, he could have let us have more Liberty, than now he durſt, becauſe of the Mayor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One day two Country-men were paſſing by the Priſon with their Teams, the which Men came and enquired, What we were impriſoned for? And the Goaler being by, inticed them into us, and then he lockt the Door again, and went his way; ſo the men were conſtrained (by reaſon of their Teams) to ſend ſeveral Meſſengers with intreating Words to the Goaler, to come again, and then they were forced to agree with him for to let them forth for Money, the which they preſently paid.</p>
            <p>Another time one of the Town came in the Priſon to ſee us, when the Goaler was there, and the Doors open, and the Goaler lockt the Door, and kept him in that Day from his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that Night; and his Wife nor her Friends could not prevail with the Mayor nor the Goaler to let him out without Money.</p>
            <p>Alſo, <hi>James Wall,</hi> a Priſoner, who had ſerved ſeven Years an Apprenticeſhip in the Town, and a Free-man thereof, and hath born ſeveral Offices, being a Shop-keeper, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for ſeven Years kept a ſtanding in the Market place, until ſince he was Priſoner, that the Mayor <hi>Edmond Young</hi> forbad his Wife, neither would he let her ſtand that time where he was uſed to do, nor in any place of the Market; Then ſhe went to him concerning it; and once he ſaid, ſhe ſhould have a ſtanding for two Pence; but after he began to ſpeak ſuttilly to her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I hear that your Huſband doth abuſe you.</hi> She anſwered, My Husband did never abuſe me; but as for that Judgment which he now holdeth, I could not own, but now ſeeing it is ſo much perſecuted makes me own it, becauſe the Way of God was always perſecuted. And when the Mayor heard that, and ſaw he could have no occaſion againſt her Husband by her Words, then he ſaid, <hi>She ſhould not have a ſtanding for 5 l.</hi> Alſo two of <hi>James Wall</hi>'s Chapmen came to him, with whom he had dealed much, and their Accounts were large, and ſome Money he owed them, who went to the Mayor and proffered what Bale he would deſire for him, to come forth one day to perfect his Accounts. But they could not prevail with him; but the Mayor ſaid to them,
<pb facs="tcp:66375:24"/> 
               <hi>If they would have a Warrant to ſeize on his Goods, they ſhould.</hi> But the men ſaid, They had no reaſon ſo to do (for the Mayor he ſeeks to ruinate others alſo.) On that day we were before the late Mayor, <hi>George Kemp;</hi> I ſaid, I own Magiſtrates that are for the Puniſhing of Evil-doers, and the Praiſe of them that do well: He anſwered, <hi>You will find no ſuch in England</hi> (and I am ſure I find no ſuch in <hi>Eveſham.</hi>)</p>
            <p>On the 17th of the 9th Moneth, <hi>Margerat Newby</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Quorte</hi> came to this Town in obedience to the Lord, who had a Meeting on the morrow (being the Firſt-day) in private at <hi>Edward Pitway</hi>'s, and after the Meeting ended, about the fourth Hour, in the latter part of the Day, they came to the Priſon to viſit us that were in it, and as they were returning, the Mayor laid violent Hands on them, and put them in the Priſon above us, and then cauſed them to be put in the Stocks that are in that Priſon, which Stocks are made worſe then ordinarily, with places to put in both Hands, in which Stocks an Hours puniſhment is very bad; and after a Conſtable had put them in, the Mayor went up unto them, to ſee if they were puniſhed bad enough, and cauſed them to be removed as far aſunder as might be, that they might not one help or eaſe another, if they could; and ſo, left them with both their Legs therein, with two holes diſtance between their Legs, in a moſt barbarous &amp; ſhameful manner, and <hi>beaſtly words</hi> he uſed to them; and ſo went thence &amp; lockt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-door, that no <hi>Friends</hi> could come nigh them, it being a <hi>freezing night,</hi> in which manner they were kept the ſpace of 15 <hi>hours at leaſt;</hi> the like Puniſhment ſeldom heard of: I have thoughts that <hi>Paul</hi>'s forty Stripes ſave one; was not ſo bad. And after they had been in that manner all that time, then the Mayor cauſed them to be taken out, and ſent preſently in the Cold out of the Town a back way, without any ſtay for any outward Comfort. And the ſame Firſt-day at Night, a Friend that came to the Town the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being at the Priſon hole, was put in the common Stocks by the Mayor's order, <hi>not ſhewing him any reaſon why they did;</hi> and after he had been in the Stocks all that <hi>freezing Night</hi> in the <hi>Street,</hi> then the Mayor ſent him out of the Town by the Goaler; but when the Goaler had left him, he returned to the Town again along the Road-way, it being the Market day, and came to the Priſon to us, and then went to the Mayor, to know what offence
<pb facs="tcp:66375:25"/> he had to charge him with, that he had thus puniſhed him for: But the Mayor having nothing to accuſe, but was wroth, and ſent him to the Stocks again, where both his Feet were put in; and then they ſent for <hi>Robert Vens,</hi> who did go along with the Friend forth of the Town, that had been in the Stocks all Night; and when <hi>Robert Vens</hi> came before them called Juſtices, <hi>Samuel. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denar</hi> and <hi>Robert Maiten,</hi> the one of them ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we do with this Fellow?</hi> The other anſwered, <hi>Put him in the Goal.</hi> But at laſt they ſent him to the Stocks, and he knows no reaſon why they did it, but for going with the other Friend out of the Town; and when he had been in the Stocks <hi>five hours,</hi> then they ſent for him to ſee what the Goaler had to charge him with, for any words that he might ſpeak, when he went with the other Friend; ſo when they had puniſhed him, they went to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what offence he had done, and finding none, they let him go.</p>
            <p>When this Perſecution begun in <hi>Evoſham,</hi> and the Corruption of the Magiſtrates did ſo plainly appear, ſome of the Inhabitants intended to ſend two men to the <hi>Protector</hi> to acquaint him, and they writ ſomething to that effect to ſend by them, the which Writing was ſubſcribed with about fifty Hands to it, that by it the Protector might know what corrupt men were in Authority in this Town; but I ſaid unto them, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The firſt Prieſthood being made in the time of the Oath, under which Prieſthood the Swearing is upheld, and the People continue in the Swearing and in the Strife.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood is made with the Oath, the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof is the End of all Strife, Debate and Diſſention, and the End of the Luſt, from whence the Wars, Fightings, and vain Janglings doth ariſe: And the Confirmation of this Oath, and the ſecond Miniſtry, which is confirmed by this Oath, puts an end to all Oaths and Swearing, the Word of the Oath being come, and become Fleſh, which Word was before the Oath, and the World, and ſince the Law, which Word is the Son, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all, Heb.</hi> 6. 15, 16. &amp; Chap. 7. 20. <hi>Mat. 5. 34.

            <p>The firſt Prieſthood and its Miniſtry under the firſt Covenant had a command to receive Tythes of the People; yet they were not to ſue People at the Law, if they did not bring the Tythes, but were to receive the Tythes and Offerings; when they were brought, their command was to receive them: And theſe Tythes were given unto the Stranger, unto the Fatherleſs, and to the Widdow, that they might eat and be filled, as well as the Levite and the Prieſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 12, 13.

            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood and its Miniſtry is of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, where the Law is changed, by which the firſt is made; and this is not of the World, neither upheld nor maintained by the things of the World, neither is made by a Carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but by the Power of an Endleſs Life, <hi>Heb. 7. 16.

            <p>The firſt Prieſthood is of the firſt Covenant, which makes nothing perfect, and ſtands without, as in Tables of Stone, and divers Ordinances written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a Miniſter of that Law which condemns, and yet is glorious in its time, 2 <hi>Cor. 37. 8, 9. Heb.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood is of the New Covenant, which is written in the Tables of the Heart, by a Mediator of a better Covenant, in which Covenant there is a coming to be preſented Perfect in the Head, unto which, by the Miniſtry of the Word of Life, they come to be joyned, 2 <hi>Cor 3. 2, 3.

            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood ſtands in one offering for Sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Sin is taken away, <hi>Zach. 13. 1. 1 John 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Ron. 6. 2. &amp; 7. &amp; 18. Heb.</hi> 10. 17.</p>

            <p>Under the ſecond Prieſthood the Vail is rent, and the broken Heart is known, with whom God is; and ſo him that is entred within the Vail is ſeen, even him that is the end of the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. Ch. 10. 20.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prieſthood hath the Shewbread, which the carnal Eye may ſee, and the natural Man perceive; and ſo the Worſhip ſtands in outward ſhew, in ſome form and place where the Life is not, and ſuch may worſhip they know not what, being not come to the Truth which makes free to worſhip in, <hi>Heb. 9. 1, 2. John</hi> 4. 22.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood hath the Bread of Life which comes down from Heaven, and gives Life; the which Bread being not in outward ſhew, was not only hid from the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who had the Oracles of God outwardly, but alſo from them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt without them only; for there is a time wherein Chriſt is known after the Fleſh, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that is with you ſhall be in you, John</hi> 14. 17.

            <p>In the time of the ſecond Prieſthood the Teſtimony and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is raiſed up, and the Mercy-ſeat opened, and the hardneſs of Heart broken, and ſo the Wall that's ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him: and his Teſtimony comes to be broken down, and the Fountain of living Mercies opened, and the Soul refreſhed with the hidden Manna; ſo the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> comes to be raiſed up through the Vail by the power of him who is the living Miniſter within the Vail, made under the Law, to redeem the Soul from under the Law; and ſo as this is read in the work of it, and ſo felt and underſtood, the Promiſe of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, under the Miniſtry of the ſecond Prieſthood, is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, even as it is written, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People, 2 Cor. 6. 16.

            <p>In the time of the firſt Prieſthood there is much talking of the Ordinances, and many are pleading from the Letter for the Ordinances, which ſay, <hi>They are to laſt forever,</hi> (as Circumciſion was) and alſo many are crying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord;</hi> and yet the Temple is made [by ſuch] a den of Thieves, and a habitation of Dragons, and wild ſubtil devouring Beaſts of the Field, who have ſtollen up another way (in the Serpents wiſdom) than by Chriſt the Light and the

            <p>In the time of the ſecond Prieſthood the Kingdom is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which is not in Words, but in Power, where the proud Boaſters are ſhut out, and the Unclean enters not, nor the vain Janglers, who come with their carnal Weapons from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without, to fight againſt the Lamb, whoſe Commands are written in the Heart, where the Holy Ghoſt is by ſuch reſiſted, who are not come to the ſecond Miniſtry, where all things are compleat in him who is the Head, the Beginning and the End, in whom the Circumciſion made without Hands is witneſſed; ſo the Vail is taken off the Heart, and the end is ſeen, even he that takes away the Sin of the World; and ſo all Treſpaſſes come to be forgiven unto them that are buried in the Baptiſm, and ſo dead unto Sin, whereby alſo the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances was againſt us, comes to be blotted out and nailed down to the Croſs, whereby the Principalities and Powers are ſpoiled by the Power of the Word that becomes Fleſh, whereby thoſe things that were in ſhew are triumphed over, and nailed down to the Croſs, through which the Life comes to be raiſed, and ſo Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God comes to be revealed and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, being quickned in the Spirit; and ſo no more to know Chriſt after the Fleſh, but in that which is raiſed up through the Croſs, unto which the ſhews and ſhadows of things are nailed

            <p>In the time of the firſt Prieſthood, the outward Blood was to purifie, the tranſgreſſion being without, and the law without; And ſo, here is the outward Waſhings, with the outward Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the ſet dayes of Purification; and theſe things were to be done often, becauſe of the continual Tranſgreſſion of that Law which ſtood without, which came to be fulfilled; and did not Chriſt Jeſus ſuffer without the Gate, <hi>Heb. 9. 23.

            <p>In the time of the ſecond Prieſthood, the heavenly things themſelves are purified with better ſacrifices then theſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 23. which ſerved to the purifying of the Patterns, and the heavenly things themſelves, being purified with the living ſacrifice; ſo the way into the Holyeſt of all is known, which is not manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the firſt Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8.

And if there be a triumphing over theſe things which are in ſhow, before the entrance into the Holieſt of all be made, how much more are the outward ſhows triumphed over, and the Principalities ſpoiled, when the way into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all is made manifeſt by the Power of him who is gone into the Heavens, and is on the right hand of God; Angels, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and Powers being made ſubject unto him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22.</p>

            <p>Therefore lament, O ye Inhabitants of the Earth, for the Lord is become your Enemy by reaſon of your Sins; he is rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Snares as thick as Hail-ſtones upon you; and the VViſe men shall be taken in their own Craftineſs, Judges led away Fools, Princes laid in the Duſt, Diviners turned Mad, and a Curſe will come upon all your goodly things: Y your Glory shall vaniſh as the Duſt, and your Beauty shall be as the Dung upon the Earth: Your Riches ſhall eat you up as a Moth doth a Garment; your chiefeſt Delights will be your greateſt Torment: For the Lord is making the Earth empty, and Wo to the Inhabitants thereof for evermore; no Deliverer in it shall be found, neither yet any to comfort you; therefore shall the Young man VVeep and VVail, &amp; the Strong man Cry bitterly; In that day the Prieſts shall Howl, the Honourable Lament, and the Ancient go Mourning all the day long: For the Lord is changing Times and Seaſons, and the Iniquity of the People is aſcended up, and the remembrance of the VVicked is come before him, and once more will the Lord shake his Hand againſt the Wicked, as in the day of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and overturn the Oppreſſors, as in the day of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and shake the Heavens, the Earth, and the Sea; and this shall be known when the Lord paſſeth through the Earth with his grounded Staff, and Battels of Shakings.</p>

            <p>And theſe things will certainly come to paſs, and then ſhall all the <hi>Heathen</hi> know, that the Lord is the ſame that ever he was, and that he hath heard the Cry of the Oppreſſed, and ſeen the Affliction of his People, and taken notice of all your ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances againſt them who are born of, and led by the Spirit, who are as the ſound of the Wind unto you, that know not whence they come, nor whither they go, who now ſuffer by you with Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him forever and ever, when he who is their Life, ſhall appear to confound <hi>Zion's</hi> Enemies forever, and overturn the very Foundations of the Wicked, though never ſo great and high, and bring down the Mighty from their Ungodly Seats, and overturn the Inventions of the Wicked, and pour forth Everlaſting Judgment upon the Beaſt, and all them that bear his Mark, or worſhip his Image: And when the Whore ſhall have Blood to drink, and the Mouthes of her Merchants ſtopt forever, and all them that love and make Lyes their Refuge, with all the Unclean and Unbelieving (who receive Honour one of another) and all the Blood-thirſty turned into the Lake, then ſhall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſpread over the Nations as the Morning-due, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the Light of the Sun in Summer, and Judgment run down as Water, and Peace ſpring up as a Fountain that overflows and is never dry.</p>
            <p>In that day ſhall the poor of the Flock be gathered, and the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> return; Deliverance ſhall come to the Captives,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66375:38"/> and Joy to them that have Mourned; the Wilderneſs ſhall then rejoyce, and the Deſart be glad for evermore; Springs ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the Deſart, and a Fountain ſhall be opened in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the Standerd of the Lord shall be lifted up on High, the ſcattered in the Deſart, and the Meek of the Earth ſhall flow unto it: Nations ſhall turn unto the Lord of Hoſts, and People be gathered to the Banner of the Moſt High; they ſhall feed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the Lambs in the Morning, and be ſatisfied as the Flock in Summer; and then ſhall <hi>Zion's</hi> Mourners be comforted and filled with Joy forever; then ſhall they shout aloud for Joy, with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah</hi> for evermore, when the Smoke of the Torment of the Whore (her Lovers and her Brats) aſcends up as the Smoke of <hi>Sodom</hi> forever and ever.</p>
            <p>Then shall Glory; Honour and Praiſe ariſe from them that were beheaded for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne; and the captives shall come out of their Captivity, and the Priſoner out of the Pit; and every Bond-man shall be ſet at Liberty, and thoſe that are at eaſe and Liberty in the Flesh, shall be Bound with Chains of Everlaſting Darkneſs forever and ever, and they shall be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed day and night in the preſence of the holy Angles, and in the preſence of the Lamb (who is Light) even all them who will not that he should reign, who is the <hi>Lamb</hi> &amp; the <hi>Light;</hi> and then shall they ſee <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who wandered up and down, and were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth; theſe, with all their Seed then shall they ſee in the Kingdom and Dominion of God, and they themſelves shut out; and ſo the Parable of the Rich man and <hi>Lazarus</hi> shall they know fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Wo, Wo, Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and all you the Enemies of the Lamb, by reaſon of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are yet to come; for your Proud Fleſh, which is as the Fleſh of Horſes, ſhall be as Dung upon the Earth, and your Fleſh is to be given unto the Fowls of the Air to feed upon; for the Day of the great Slaughter is at hand, and the Battel of the great King ſhall be ſet in order, and every Battel of the Warrier is with confuſed Noiſe, and Garments rolled in Blood; but this ſhall be with Burning and Fuel of Fire, and Blood ſhall all them

            <p>MAny Dayes and Nights, and Times, and Seaſons, for many Weeks and Moneths, of late Years, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deep and ſerious Conſiderations been in me, and many Meditations in my Mind and Heart, in the true fear of the living God, and often times in quietneſs (waiting on the Lord God of <hi>Abraham</hi>) hath my Spirit had ſecret and private, yet plain Conference with the Lord, concerning the Teachers and Leaders of the People, even the Hireling Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> (and other Nations) and the Followers of them. And when I have weighed all in an equal Ballance, I have found that it hath been
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66375:39"/> in pure Love to the Souls all Mankind, and without Prejudice or Envy to them, their Bodies or Perſons, as they are the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God; and the eternal Witneſs of God, in his Covenant of Life, hath, and doth, and will juſtifie me herein forever.</p>
            <p>And when I have looked back upon the Teachers, and ſeen what a ſtir and a noiſe is made among them about <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Faith in his Blood,</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Juſtification by him,</hi> and all proceeding from that nature in them, which is at Enmity with God: And when I have ſeen how many Thouſand Thouſands, and Hundreds of times ten Thouſands following of them, and Contending, Fighting, Stoning, Whipping and Impriſoning for them, and are guided, or rather blinded by them: And when I have ſeen what care is taken for them, and to uphold them, by the great Rulers of the Nations, even <hi>Protector, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> (beſides many Thouſands of bruitiſh People that are ſtoning and fighting for them) that they might be upheld and maintained, yea, even in Exceſs and Fulneſs, from the Peoples hard Labours: And when I have ſeen how many Hundred Thouſand Pounds every year, they have received from the People: And when I ſeen, that notwithſtanding all this, the People are ſtill in Tranſgreſſion, and ſo under the Wrath of God, and yet know not how to come out of their Sin, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth from God, but that many Thouſands dye in their Sins, and many more are pleading for Sin, and many end their dayes in a Bed of Torment, gaſping, ſtrugling, grovelling and raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in unquietneſs, under the horrible Terrors of the unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fierce Indignation of the Wrath of the Almighty, and ſo go down into the Pit forever, as many have done, not knowing a reſting place in the peaceable ſtillneſs of God's Covenant of Life and Peace.</p>
            <p>Oh! when (I ſay) I have beheld, and deeply conſidered theſe things, and many more which might be named, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pondered them in my Heart, from a true ſenſe of God's Pity to the precious Souls of all Mankind; and from a true Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Terrible <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rning for the ſlain of the People, who thus are cut off from God, and ſeparated from the Land of the Living. O Wo is me! becauſe of theſe things my Soul hath been oppreſſed, and my Spirit grieved; and to the Lord alone hath a grievous Cry aſcended up, and I have ſaid, <hi>Oh that I could Mourn and Weep yet more in ſecret becauſe of theſe things!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when I have looked upon the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> I have ſeen plainly and truly from the Lord God, That the Spirit of Error and Ignorance in them, hath been and is the very cauſe of all this Diſorder, &amp; Soul-Periſhing ſtate, that is in and upon the Sons of men, and their continuance therein; then hath my Spirit ſaid within me, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth it must dye, but the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their Blood at the hands of thoſe that have cauſed them to Err:</hi> And the Lord hath ſaid unto me concerning theſe Prieſts and Teachers, <hi>My hand is againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when I have looked farther back, and conſidered them who were made Miniſters by a known Law of God, that they were declared againſt by the Spirit of Propheſie, and that they were ſuch Shepherds that could not underſtand, being greedy, and could never have enough, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10, 11. and that they were bruitiſh Paſtors, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 21. and as Murderers, and Troops of Robbers; and that the Lord had curſed their Bleſſings, and made them baſe and contemptible in the Eys of the People, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. Then ſaid I, Ah! what ſtate then are theſe men in, who are not made Miniſters by a Law of God, neither yet ſent forth by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. but are out of his Doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and ſo Enemies unto him, being known by their Fruits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15, 16. and are made Miniſters by the Will of men, and upheld by carnal corrupt Laws, and the Impriſoning of hundreds that are come out from them, that we may not partake in the Plagues with them, who are ſeen to be of <hi>Babel, Rev.</hi> 18. 4. in whom is found the Souls of men, and the Blood of all the Saints, from <hi>Abel</hi> unto this day; and they have been upheld by the devouring of Widdows Houſes, the robbing of the Fatherleſs, the ſpoiling of the Goods of Hundreds, the Impriſoning of many until Death, the Rifling, and Robbing of whole Houſes, as may be witneſſed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Kent</hi> (by a Paper entituled, <hi>A Horrible thing,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66375:40"/> of Sufferings</hi> for <hi>Tythe</hi> and many other parts in the Nation: And when I have beheld theſe things, I have ſaid in mine Heart, Thoſe Miniſters (or rather Deceivers) are far ſhort, and much worſe than them in the Prophets dayes, who were made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by a Law of God, though they became as Robbers and Murtherers.</p>
            <p>And then have I alſo lamented the hard hearted blindneſs of many Rulers, in theſe dayes, who have been worſe in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of thoſe, who from the Spirit of God do declare againſt theſe Miniſters made by the Wills of men, than the Rulers in the dayes of the Prophets, who did not ſo Perſecute them, that declared againſt thoſe who were made Miniſters by a Law of God: And ſurely, I have ſaid, did not theſe Prieſts bewitch the Rulers that they cannot obey the Truth? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. And ſo cauſe them to obey them, or be as it were Slaves or Pack-horſes to them, even making their boaſt in Print, that they are ſtill ſpurring on the Magiſtrate, as <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> Priest of <hi>Kidderminſter,</hi> hath written. But I ſay, were not the Magiſtrates blinded by them, and therefore uphold them by their corrupt Laws, even giving them Treble Damages, they would ſoon fall and come to nought; for they are already fallen under the Magiſtrates, and come creeping to them in the Serpents Wiſdom, upon their Bellies, which is their God, for more Duſt, or Earthly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Money, Goods, and Earthly things: But the Biſhops and the Prieſts in their dayes, were exalted above the Magiſtrates; and the Prieſts have yet that Spirit of Pride, from which they write, as if they rid upon the Magiſtrates, and ſpurred them like Horſes; and this hath been ſo, but it may be otherwife: And I have ſeen how the Beaſt, the Whore and the falſe Prophet uphold one another, and ride one upon another, and the Prieſts ſpurring up the Magiſtrates (its their own words) and all making War with them that are ſanctified, riſing up againſt them that are anointed, who need none to teach, and compaſſing about them whom God hath loved, who are of the City where the Lamb is the Light, and need not the light of the Sun nor the Moon.</p>
            <p>And when I have thus pondered the ſtate and condition both of Prieſts, Rulers and People, and compared them and their ſtate with the Prieſts, Rulers and People in the dayes of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66375:41"/> Prophets, and ſeeing the condition of theſe to be much worſe, and many things more that might be named, and that the latter end of many is like to be miſerable; and that the Name of God is blaſphemed by ſuch, who ſay they are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and are not, like them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. and that they are in the Blaſphemy, though Rich men, who do oppreſs the Poor in Spirit, and cauſe them to be drawn before the Judgement-Seats, <hi>James</hi> 2. 6, 7. even then hath the conſideration of theſe things often times brought a deep Mourning upon me, and Sorrow hath filled my Heart. But when on the other hand, I have ſeen the Work of the Lord ſecretly going on in a hidden manner, opening the Eyes and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many Rulers in the Nation; and that many who are, and have been in Authority amongſt Men, and in the Army (have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and) are believing in him who ſaid, <hi>I am the Light,</hi> and is the Lord of Glory, though as a Lamb dumb, and a man of Sorrows, not pleading his own Cauſe, nor having whereon to lay his Head, but Sick and in Priſon; and that many devout and honourable Women, (as in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 12.) are alſo coming, and come to the Faith which purifies the Heart, and Reſpects no mans Perſon, without which Faith in the Heart walked by, its impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>And when the Eye of my Mind hath been fixed upon that Object, then hath my Soul magnified the Lord therein, and my Spirit hath rejoyced becauſe of him that bringeth, and is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation; and becauſe of Righteouſneſs, Peace and true Judgment that the Lord is ſetting up over all, in the Hearts of many Rulers, and Devout and Honourable among the People, that in Righteouſneſs, throught Humility, they may come to be renowned with Honour forever.</p>
            <p>Theſe things on that hand (and much which is coming to paſs for an Everlaſting Good among the People, and is revealed in the Light and Fore-knowledge of God) hath given ſome eaſe to my Wounded and Troubled Spirit, and the Refreſhings of my Father's Love hath bound me up in the Covenant of Life, with the tender Seed in thoſe whom the Lord is drawing by his Love, through Humility, to the durable Honour and Riches which will never fade: Surely herein hath my Soul been made as a watred Garden, with the Influences of my Father's Love, ſo that living
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66375:41"/> Praiſes over all hath aſcended up to him, whoſe Name is bleſſed for evermore, becauſe he worketh, and none can let him.</p>
            <p>But when I have looked back again upon the Prieſts, and the many hundred Thouſand Souls, that are kept in the Witchcraft (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.) Rebellion, (<hi>Job</hi> 24. 13.) gain-ſaying, blindneſs and ignorance, and the daily murthering of the Souls of ſo many, then becauſe of the Shepherds, who deſtroy the Flock, there hath been in me a Lamentation, and a Cry: Oh the Prieſts, the Prieſts! ſurely Vengeance is prepared of God for them, Wrath, Indignation, Curſing, (<hi>Mal. 2. 2. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 14.) Bitterneſs, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Perplexity, Aſtoniſhment of Heart, Endleſs Miſery and Shame amongſt men, from the wrathful Vengance of the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Terrors of God, will come upon them in a Day unaware, and their Houſes ſhall be left unto them deſolate; and they ſhall become a By-word among the People, as I have already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, from the dreadful Indignation of the Lord God of Hoſts, in a Book entituled, <hi>An Alarum,</hi> even ſo ſhall it come to paſs upon them; behold, it is haſtning the Lord God of Hoſts hath ſpoken it, and his Word ſhall not fail, neitheir ſhall his Decree be changed.</p>
            <p>And when theſe things have come upon me, even as a Flood of mighty Waters, then have I ſaid in the Grief of my Heart, alas for the Prieſts! The Prieſts, even the Leaders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where will they hide themſelves in this day of ſierce Wrath, and ſiery Indignation from the Jealous God of Majeſty that is near at hand? Oh! how will Shame cover their Faces? and how will their Countenances fall like <hi>Cain?</hi> and how will they Curſe like <hi>Shimei,</hi> even their God (and their King) who is the God of the World (and their Belly is their God?) and how will they ſeek Repentance with Tears like <hi>Eſau,</hi> who might have ſaid, He was of <hi>Abraham?</hi> And how will they Repent too late like <hi>Judas,</hi> who had obtained part of the Miniſtry, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 17. and yet denyed him that was the Light, and betrayed him who comes to make an end of Sin, and was a Devil, and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet had obtained part of the Miniſtry. Alas for the Prieſts of <hi>England!</hi> Are not they worſe then <hi>Judas?</hi> Did not he bring again and reſtore the Silver which he had taken? And can the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> do ſo? Nay, they have waſted it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66375:42"/> the Luſt and Pride, even abundance; ſo that if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all that they have left, with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhould be ſold at the utmoſt value (though I not deſire it ſhould be ſo) yet thereby could they not reſtore the tenth part, nor one part in a hundred, of the Silver which they have taken; nor bring again the Money, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, which they have gained.</p>
            <p>Therefore have I ſaid, Surely a ſad Day will come upon them, when they become a By-word, and a hiſſing to all People, and are turned out of their Parſonages, Glebe-Lands, Tythes, Treble Damages, and old Maſs-Houſes, as their Fathers the Biſhops, and Deans, and Quireſters, and Singing-Men and Boys, were turned out of their Pomp and Pride, vain Glory, Covetouſneſs, Exaction and Tyranny, and out of their Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, Denaries, and the like: And when alſo that Gods Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall ariſe in them to confound them within, and the Light of Chriſt condemn them for their Deceit and Hypocriſie, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, Pride, Idleneſs, fulneſs of Bread, Extortion, and all manner of Wickedneſs; Oh the Prieſts, the Prieſts have ſaid, <hi>What a Day will this be unto them!</hi> Surely then, as I ſaid, and ſay again, That the Shepherds ſhall Howl, and a bitter Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſts ſhall be heard in all the Land, yea, the noiſe of their bitter Cry ſoundeth already in my Heart; and behold, I have ſeen their Wo, which is near at hand, their Wives alſo ſhall be left as Widdows, and their Children as Fatherleſs, and from the pitiful Benovelence of the People muſt they be kept from Periſhing in their Bodies; but alas for their Souls! who ſhall deliver them? And herein moreover is their State and Condition the more Miſerable, becauſe they will not regard this, neither would they at all be warned by them whom the Lord hath ſent amongſt them; and becauſe they will not ſee when the hand of the Lord is lifted up, neither regard the Word of his Power, therefore for their Envy to the Lords People ſhall they be aſhamed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 11. that upon them it may be fulfilled, which is written, <hi>Behold, I work a Work in your days, ye Deſpiſers, which you ſhall in no wiſe believe, though a man declare it unto you,</hi> Acts 13. 41.</p>
            <p>Therefore have I conſidered, in the very depth of my ſecret Meditations, what ſhall be ſaid or done in theſe things, when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66375:42"/> the Prieſts have violated the Law, and made void that which is Perfect, and the Leaders of the People rebel againſt the Light, <hi>Job</hi> 24. 31. and harden their Hearts againſt Reproof, and will not be warned, that they might eſcape the Dreadful day at hand; therefore have I ſaid, Ah! ſurely the Lord will root them up, Head and Tail, Branch and Root in one day: Ah! fruitleſs Trees, ſaid I, have not you your ſelves yet brought forth the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, which is Love? And are not ye your ſelves yet come to that which fulfills the Law of God, to wit, <hi>Love?</hi> And are not all without it as ſounding Braſs, having the Tongues, and the like, making a Noiſe among the People, like ſounding Braſs, and pleaſing their Fancies as tinkling Cimbals, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And have you been all this while ſowing to the Fleſh? And are you the men who deny him that makes an end of Sin, and his Blood which cleanſeth from all Sin, and the Faith which puriſieth the Heart? And are you the men who deny the true Light of him, who ſaid, <hi>I am the Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the World?</hi> Are you the men that deny the Son of God, and will ye not that he ſhould reign, that is of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> who wandered up and down? And is it you that are ſaying one to another, and to the Rulers of the Earth, concerning him that is the Light, <hi>This is the Heir, come let us Kill him?</hi> And would you not that he ſhould Rule, who condemns Sin, and ſaveth his People from thir Sins, and maketh an end of Sin? Surely, have I ſaid, even therefore will the Lord reward you, according to the Fruit of your own Ways; and as you have denyed him, ſo muſt you be condemned by him that is the Light, <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 19. And as you have been, and yet are (with <hi>Pilate,</hi> and others) of <hi>Babel,</hi> in the many Languages and Tongues, upon which the Whore ſits; and as you have been, and yet are of the Nations, which are drunk with the Wine of the Fornication of the Whore, the great Whore, <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> that ſits upon many Waters, and hath corrupted the Earth; and as you have been drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and made rich by the Robbing and Spoiling of the Houſes and Goods of many (even as Troops of Robbers, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 9. Forty in one Troop lately at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> feeding their Belly, their God.) And as you have devoured Widdows Houſes, and been drunk with the Wine of the Fornication of the Whore,

            <p>And when I have waited to ſee the end of theſe things, and pondered this in my Heart, in the Uprightneſs of Innocency and pure Simplicity of God; then hath it been ſaid in me, Where then will the Memorial of this Prieſthood of theſe Nations, who came up ſince the Apoſtles days, and were deſcended from the Biſhops, that were commiſſionated by the Pope, and eſtabliſhed by the See of <hi>Rome!</hi> And what a Howling, and a bitter Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will come upon many in that day, when <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> the Mother of all theſe painted Harlots, comes to be overturned forever? How then will the Great men, and the Rich men, and the Mighty Ones of the Earth, Mourn and Lament, becauſe of the Deſolation of the Whore (with whom they have all along committed Fornication) and to ſee theſe her Children (the painted Harlots, the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> who are covered with Saints words) even daſhed to pieces with the Light, which is the Stone that is falling upon them, to grind them to Powder? Alas! alas! ſay they, how many were made Rich? And how many of our Children were like to be made Rich by being bred up under the Skirts of this Woman, who hath a Golden Cup in her Hand, holding it forth to all that will come to her? And how many young men began to love her? <hi>Pov.</hi> 7. Alas! ſay they, were not many of our Children looking at the Golden Cup, and and growing up under her Wing at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in divers other Schools and Nurſeries, where the Languages and Tongues are, even Multitudes, upon which the Whore ſits, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 1, 15. who hath the Golden Cup, at which the Kings, and the Great Ones of the Earth have drunk abundantly! And muſt this Woman be laid Deſolate? And muſt her Children be daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pieces againſt the Stone? (the Light) therefore is the Cry great, and the Lamentation will be grievous, when the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is come to the full, the Sin ripe unto Judgment, the Beaſt fully fatted for the Day of Slaughter, and that come to paſs,

               </gap>ning ſuddenly, though few can receive theſe things (unexpected by many) revealed in me, and the more are they, and many other People hardened and blinded herein, becauſe the Prieſts are ſo high, ſo great, and ſo ſtrong, and upheld by the ſtrength of ſuch Laws, even exceeding and doubling in their Power and Authority, the Laws that were made for the upholding of their Predeceſſors, the Jeſuites and Popiſh Prieſts, in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Law was but three Moneths Impriſonment, and now it is ſix; and then the Law was but for the Tythes, and now it is three times as much, and ſo they are more higher exalted than ever, and our Task is doubled and trebled upon us; and beſides, they cry out, <hi>We are Idle, and wander up and down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let me Reaſon a little; Was it not ſuddenly after their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was doubled, that the Lord overturned the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrength of the Oppreſſors forever? and was not the cry of the oppreſſed great, becauſe the Task was doubled upon them, who were in Bondage before? And were we not before in Bondage, under Biſhops, and Prieſts, and Kings, and Tythe, and is it now double and trebled? And is the little finger of the Prieſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heavier then the Biſhops loyns? And will not God viſit for theſe things? And doth not this ſhew that the day of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning is at hand? But ſay people, <hi>How can theſe things be, they ſeeming to be eſtabliſhed more then ever?</hi> Yet I reaſon again with ſuch; Who would before-hand have believed, that the Biſhops, who were far greater then they, ſhould have come tumbling down ſo ſoon, with perpetual Shame and Reproach; and their Common-Prayer-books taken away, with the Prieſts Idolatrous Surplices, and manv ſuch things? And hath the Lord began with them the Head? And will he not go on to finiſh his Work, in Confounding, and utter Overturning the Tail and Dreggs of them which are yet left behind, and are like unto unnatural chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, denying their Parents, the Biſhops and the Pope; and yet creep into their Maſs-houſes, and live upon the ſame Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which their Parents provided for them, and yet call the Pope, <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> (and he is ſo) their great Father, who ſet up the Biſhops, that eſtabliſhed them in their Tythe, 'Parſonages and old Maſs-houſes; and ſo the Pope being an Antichriſt, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66375:44"/> they come from the Biſhops, ſet up by the Pope, then it follows, that they are the Dreggs of Antichriſt; and if their own words, Writings, Way, Maintenance and Practices be but as it is, and doth appear, then herein I do them no wrong: And theſe things have I alſo thus conſidered, and leave to the conſideration of ſuch, who are not willing to remain in blindneſs, that ſeeing the Biſhops are overturned, though they were above the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the Prieſts may alſo ſoon be turned down by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſeeing they are fallen under the Magiſtrates already; and they ſet them up, and put them in, and turn them out at their pleaſure, and may ſoon turn them down when they are weary of being ſpurred by them.</p>
            <p>And as I have conſidered theſe things in the meditations of my Mind, ſo have I alſo conſidered the Words and Wayes of theſe Prieſts of <hi>England, Ireland, Scotland,</hi> and other Nations, and what ado and a ſtir they have kept, againſt thoſe Prieſts that cauſed Chriſt to be crucified; and how he ſuffered by them: And when I have weighed and conſidered the Actions of them Prieſts that did ſo, and the Words and Actions of theſe Prieſts, againſt them Prieſts, and the Ways of one and the other, I have then found, that theſe, in many things, are worſe then them, though they were very bad; and ſo both to be denyed, as I have conſidered according to Scripture: Thus;</p>
            <p>The Prieſts, the Readers of the Law, which diſcovers Sin, but makes nothing Perfect, and the Scribes and Phariſees had the Scriptures, and a large zealous Profeſſion thereby, but when Chriſt the living Miniſter came, who was the thing, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which the Scripture declared, from which they had the Profeſſion; he being come, they knew him not; and therefore for a time the Scribes, Phariſees and Prieſts diſputed, reaſoned and contended with him, and ſought to entangle him in his words, and did ſeek occaſion againſt him, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him to the Rulers, and he diſputed among the Doctors; but when much People believed on him, they cryed out, <hi>The whole World is gone after him,</hi> John 12. 19. Mat. 22. 15. But when he, who is the Power of God, had raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, and out of the Grave, then the chifeſt of the Prieſts and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees held a Council againſt him; then they began to ſtir, and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66375:44"/> Beaſt began to rage; and they ſaid, <hi>This man doth many Miracles, and if we let him alone, all men will believe on him, and the</hi> Romans <hi>will come, and take away both our Place and Nation, John</hi> 11. 47, 48. And ſo ſaith the Prieſts now; <hi>If we let him alone,</hi> who is the Light, <hi>all men will believe on him, and we ſhall looſe both our Place and Nation; for who will fight for us</hi> (ſay they) <hi>if all men come to believe in the Light?</hi> which lets men ſee that Wars and Fighting comes from the Luſt, which Luſt wars againſt the Soul, <hi>James</hi> 4. But one of their own Generation, even a chief Prieſt, told the reſt, <hi>They knew nothing at all, John</hi> 11. 49. (the Prieſts who deny the Light know nothing at all) and ſo theſe chief Prieſts and Phariſees, who knew nothing at all, ſought the Life of the Lamb, and to take him, <hi>verſe</hi> 57. And the chief Prieſts alſo conſulted to put <hi>Lazarus</hi> to Death alſo, <hi>John</hi> 12. 10. And ſo, the Prieſts now ſeek to kill that which Chriſt the Light, the Power of God, hath raiſed from Death, out of the Grave; for now the very thing it ſelf is come to Life out of Death, and this Torments them exceedingly, even more then all the Words, Forms, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting and Profeſſions whatſoever that was before it.</p>
            <p>And it was at the Paſſover, the Worſhip and Feaſt of the Jews that the Prieſts ſought to kill him that had raiſed the dead. And when <hi>Jezabel,</hi> whoſe blood the Dogs muſt lick, at whoſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the falſe Prophets feed, when ſhe intended to murther the Juſt, and take away the Life of the Innocent, and give his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to another, ſhe made a Feaſt, and that which feaſteth the one thing, Murthers the other: And at the <hi>Jews</hi> Feaſt, the one or the other was to be releaſt; and at the time that they keep the Paſſover, who are the <hi>Jews</hi> outwardly, then he ſuffers who is the end of the Law and the Prophets; and ſo at the Feaſt of their Paſſover the chief Prieſts ſought to kill him that was led as a Lamb dumb, and Satan entered in <hi>Judas,</hi> and after that, then <hi>Judas</hi> went out from Chriſt the Light; and when he went out it was Night, and then was the Son of man to be glorified; but <hi>Judas</hi> who went out from him that is the Light, went to the chief Prieſts and Captains; and they were glad when <hi>Judas</hi> was come among them, who was a Devil, and the chief Prieſts made a Covenant with him that was a Devil, and gave him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to betray him who is the Light; And he that took the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<pb n="04" facs="tcp:66375:45"/> had obtained part of the Miniſtry, and he was a Devil; and now ſuch Miniſters that take both the Money, Body and Goods, are worſe then <hi>Judas,</hi> whom the Prieſts ſay, <hi>was a Biſhop,</hi> (or a chief Prieſt) becauſe it is written, <hi>His Biſhop-rick let another take, Acts</hi> 1. 20. And ſuddainly after the chief Prieſts, had made a Covenant with him that was a Devil, was the <hi>Jews</hi> Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, at which time, he that comes to make an end of Sin was betrayed, and then <hi>Judas</hi> (who departed from him that is the Light, and was become a Devil) betrayed the Son of God, and had him led away to <hi>Ciaphas</hi> the High-Prieſt, and the chief Prieſts and Elders, and all the Council ſought falſe witneſs to put him to death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 59. And the chief Prieſt rent his Clothes, and accuſed him of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> in whom there is <hi>no Sin,</hi> and they all ſaid, <hi>He is worthy of Death,</hi> who ſaid, God was his Father. And when the chief <hi>Prieſts</hi> had cauſed him to be brought before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and Vehemently accuſed him of many things, yet <hi>Pilate</hi> would have releaſed him; and when the chief Pireſts and Elders ſaw that, and that one ſhould be releaſed at the Feaſt, and that it might not be the man of Sorrows, that is not of the World, but the Murtherer and Thief, that had ſtole, therefore the Prieſts and Rulers then perſwaded the Multitude, That they ſhould ask <hi>Barrabas</hi> the Thief, the Murtherer, and deſtroy Jeſus the Image of God, that comes to condemn for Sin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 20. And ſo to this day, at the time of the Feaſt, the Thief, and that which Murthers is at Liberty, and that is deſtroyed which comes to ſave from Sin.</p>
            <p>But the Govenour ſaid, <hi>Why, what Evil hath he done?</hi> And <hi>Pilate</hi> waſhed his Hands, and confeſſed him to be a Juſt Perſon; but the chief Prieſts and Scribes ſtood and vehemently accuſed him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 10. But <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid the third time, <hi>Why, what Evil bath he done; I have found no cauſe of Death in him:</hi> And yet the Prieſts even forced <hi>Pilate,</hi> to do that which was Unjuſt. And do not the Prieſts now even force the Magiſtrates, to perſecute thoſe that they find nothing in them worthy of Death or of Bonds? And ſo the Prieſts having provoked and inſtigated the People thereunto, they cryed, <hi>Away with him,</hi> (that is the Light) <hi>and Crucifie him,</hi> (that makes an End of Sin) and the chief Prieſts alſo gave their Voice with them againſt him; and ſo the Voices
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66375:45"/> of them, and of the chief Prieſts prevailed to have him ſlain, murthered and crucified, who is the Power of God, that had raiſed the Dead, in whom <hi>Pilate</hi> could find no fault, neither yet <hi>Herod;</hi> and when he was crucified, who is the Light, that condemns for Sin, then the chief Prieſts and Profeſſors kept their Feaſt, and their Paſſover with the Shew-Bread, or Unleavened-Bread, which the carnal Eye might ſee, and the murthering Prieſts feed upon, and then they may talk of their Ordinances, having ſlain him that is given for a Witneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 4. And ſo, ſuch as ſlay the Witneſs within, are talking of the Ordinances without; and they cryed, <hi>Away with him,</hi> (that is the Bread of Life) and they Crucified him (at whoſe preſence the Devils were tormented) and in the time of their Feaſt and Paſſover (who had the Oracles of God) the Witneſs of God lay ſlain; this may be read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and upon their Sabboth-Day, even the Day of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (who worſhip in the High Places) that which came to ſave from ſin, lay in the Grave, and they were reading that which diſcovered ſin, but make nothing Perfect, and him in whom there is no ſin, was in the Earth, in the time of their Worſhip, and he that was the Light in the Earth, was Perfect, but that which they read in the high Place made nothing Perfect; and the place of Holy Worſhip is to be laid deſolate, and where Chriſt (the witneſs) is not riſen, the Sin is not taken away, and there the Faith is vain. He that can receive it, let him.</p>
            <p>But after the Feaſt, he that is given for a witneſs aroſe again, and ſo before the Feaſt of the Paſſover of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, they murthered the Witneſs; and for a time, while the Witneſs lay ſlain, they kept the Paſſover with outward Bread, in an outward Temple, offering the outward Sacrifices, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Feaſt was over, and their outward Worſhip for a time ended; then he that is given for a Witneſs unto the People, aroſe again; and ſo that which leades to Feaſting, murthers the witneſs of God, yet when the feaſting is over, and the outward Profeſſion and Worſhip ended for a time, then he that is the Witneſs ariſeth, even the Light of Chriſt in the Conſcince and condemns for ſin, and then the Prieſts and Profeſſors were, and are worſe then before: And when ſome of the Watch came, and declared that he was riſen, who is given for a Witneſs [Mark,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66375:46"/> they that are upon the Watch, are the firſt that know the riſing of the Witneſs] then the chief Prieſts, who had mocked him, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 31. (the chief Prieſts were Mockers) aſſembled with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and took counſel again; for then they were more tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than before, and that which they feared, came upon them; for they ſaid, this would be worſe than that before, therefore they ſaid of him, <hi>This Deceiver ſaid, After three dayes I will riſe again; Therefore,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>let a Watch be ſet, leſt his Diſciples ſteal him away, and ſay, He is riſen, and ſo the laſt Error be worſe than the firſt.</hi> And ſo the Prieſts called the Reſurrection of Chriſt <hi>Error,</hi> and Chriſt the Light, a <hi>Deceiver;</hi> and theſe Prieſts now ſay, <hi>The Light deceiveth,</hi> or, <hi>is Natural, and not ſufficient.</hi> But Chriſt the Witneſs being riſen again, the chief Prieſts gave large Money to the Souldiers, to tell Lyes of him and his Diſciples, and cauſed them to deny the riſing of the Witneſs, as the Prieſts do now; for the Witneſs is in Man, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. And ſaid the Prieſts, <hi>If this come to the Governour's Ear, we will perſwade him, and ſecure you, Mark</hi> 27. 62, 63, 64. Chap. 28. 11, 12, 13. And ſo, the chief Prieſts gave ſome Money to have him betrayed and crucified; but they gave large Money to have the riſing of him, who is the Witneſs, the Reſurrection and the Lite denyed, after he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed &amp; crucified; and ſo them Prieſts gave their Money to have him betrayed, by him that is a Devil, and gave large Money to the Souldiers, to deny the Reſurrection of him, and to tell Lyes, and <hi>the Devil is a Lyar from the beginning, and the Father of it.</hi> O horrible Abomination and Cruelty! that ever the Prieſts, the Leaders of the People ſhould do ſuch things as theſe, and to be found themſelves the worſt of Men, or rather as Beaſts! as it is written, <hi>I ſaid in my Heart concerning the ſtate of the Sons of Men, that God might manifeſt them, and that they might ſee that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are Beaſts,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 18.</p>
            <p>And theſe things may be a warning both to all <hi>Governours, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Souldiers &amp; People,</hi> that they may never more be deceived by, nor joyn to have a hand with the Subtil, Treacherous, Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prieſts, (againſt the Innocent) who by their ſubtilty did and do overcome both <hi>Governours, Judges, Rulers, Souldiers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and ſo crucified the Lord of Glory, and make it their buſineſs ever ſince to keep People from believing in him, who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66375:46"/> ſaid, <hi>I am the Light, believe in the Light,</hi> John 8. 12. ch. 12. 35, 36, 46.</p>
            <p>But mark and conſider; Were thoſe Prieſts Wicked herein? And were they Murderers and Abominable? Then have I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how much worſe, and how far more Abominable are theſe Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> and other Nations thereabouts, who do ſeldom give People large Money to tell Lyes, after they have taught them ſo to do (unleſs it be when they hire them to tell Lyes and Swear too, in bearing falſe Witneſs for them, againſt the Innocent) but they commonly force People to give large Money to them for teaching them to tell Lyes, and to deny and murder the Witneſs in themſelves, which Witneſs comes to be received by believing in the Light, <hi>John</hi> 12. 36. ch. 1. 11, 12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. And ſeeing theſe Prieſts do now get large Money, or take it by Force, for telling the People many large Repititions in their Pulpits, one year after another, How Chriſt was cauſed to be crucified and murdered by the other Prieſts, who gave Money to have it done; and the People know that already.</p>
            <p>And when I have conſidered, how many Hundred Thouſand Pounds a year theſe Prieſts do receive, and take by force, for telling the People, how Chriſt the Light ſuffered under the other Prieſts; and how he that condemns ſin in the Fleſh, and ſaves from Sin, was called a <hi>Deceiver</hi> by the other Prieſts, then have I ſaid, ſurely theſe Prieſts are worſe than the other; for they gave their Money, even large Money, but theſe take Money, and Money that is much more large, and take it by Force too, even Treble Damage, or three times Treble what they demand, and Rob whole Houſes, and have got the Rulers to uphold them in it, (<hi>never ſuch Robbers!</hi>) and take Tythe by force from ſuch as hear them not: And the firſt Prieſts that I read of in Scripture, who would take the Tythe or Offerings by Force, were the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and knew not God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12, 16. and they ſaid, <hi>If you will not give it us, we will take it by force.</hi> And ſo, they that took the Tythe or Offerings by force, were Sons of <hi>Belial:</hi> And ſuch Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> now, who know not God, do not only take the Tythe and Offerings, but they take even Three times, or Sixteen times as much in ſome places, and ſometimes the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of men beſides. And thoſe Prieſts formerly did give their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66375:47"/> Money; and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have given Money for the holy Ghoſt, but now theſe Prieſts force People to give them Money for their Meanings of the Letter: And when I have ſeriouſly conſidered theſe things, I have even ſtood as a man amazed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Who would, or how could I formerly have believed, that theſe Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> were ſo far worſe than them Prieſts that made a Covenant with a Devil, and that cauſed Chriſt to ſuffer? Or who would have believed, that they were worſe than <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in compelling People to give them much Money for their Meanings from the Letter? whereas he would have given his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney freely for the Spirit; but the Spirit they have not to ſell, but if they had, what would they not do for the love of Money, which is ſo rooted in their Hearts? would they not do as <hi>Judas</hi> did, who ſold him that was his Maſter? but I do not believe they would bring again the Money as <hi>Judas</hi> did, though he was a Devil.</p>
            <p>And who could have believed, that theſe Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> were ſo far worſe than the Sons of <hi>Ely,</hi> who were Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and knew not God; for they would take but the Tythe and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings by force, but theſe Prieſts take the Tythe and Offerings, and much more, and the Bodies of Men and Women alſo, and keep them in Priſon until Death, for whom they do no Work, and who deſire none of their Miniſtry? And if they herein be not worſe than the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> let all ſober-minded judge, and conſider this thing with me, that the firſt Prieſts that cauſed their Servants to take the Offerings by force, knew not God; then ſay I, Alas! alas! for the Prieſts of <hi>England!</hi> are they ſo much worſe than thoſe that knew not God? How doth their Shame appear? And who could have believed, that theſe Prieſts were worſe than <hi>Judas,</hi> that was a Devil, who brought the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney again that he had received? But when do theſe Prieſts bring again the Money and Goods which they have received and taken away by force? (though <hi>Judas</hi> did not take his Money by force) And how hard are theſe words to be received by ſuch who have not yet come to ſee and underſtand theſe things? And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing will the Prieſts themſelves be, to believe the truth of this which I have thus weighed, and conſidered, and pondered in the Meditations of my Mind? What horrible things from the Pit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66375:47"/> of Darkneſs are theſe, that the Prieſts ſhould be worſe than <hi>Judas!</hi> for after he had betrayed the Innocent, he confeſſed, <hi>He had ſinned,</hi> and brought back the Money, but the Prieſts ſaid, <hi>What is that to us?</hi> And are not theſe Prieſts worſe than they; for theſe do not only cauſe the betraying of the Innocent, and ſay, <hi>What is that to us?</hi> but they take Money, and force People to give them large Money, for betraying that which is Innocent in them, by their Subtilty and Craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; and when they have betrayed the Innocent Principle of God in People, by telling them, <hi>It will deceive them,</hi> yet they will not bring the Peoples Money back, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, nor ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they have ſinned therein, but are Impudent: O hard hearted and unreaſonable Men! (have I ſaid) What ſhall be ſaid unto them? Surely they are the worſt of men, and it had been good for them they had never been born, or had a beeing upon the Earth. Did the Prophet Mourn over, or Cry aloud unto them that ſpent their Money and Labour for that which ſatisfieth not? Oh! what ſhall I then ſay or write, or how ſhall I cry loud enough or mourn enough yet more in ſecret, or ſound a Trumpet to theſe dead ſleepy Prieſts, who compell People to give them ſo much Money, or ſpoil their Goods, or impriſon their Bodies till Death, for that which is ſo far from ſatisfying them, that their Souls are murthered thereby, and the innocent meek thing in them betrayed, and the Witneſs denyed? Oh! who can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from declaring this? And who can but write it in a Book, that they may ſee the State which they are in, and that People may know them by their Fruits, which did never ſo plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as now?</p>
            <p>And when theſe things came upon me, in the deep Meditation of my Mind, and Conference in my Spirit, what a Condition was I often in! and how was my Soul overcome with Sorrow, my Spirit with Heavineſs, and mine Eyes with Tears? When did the Prophets ever ſee ſuch a Generation of Prieſts as theſe? And what manner of Lamentaion ſhall I take up becauſe of theſe things? Surely I will cry aloud unto the Lord in ſecret, and my Soul ſhall pour forth Interceſſion to my Maker, and with Tears, as ſtreams of Water, will I beg at the Throne of the Moſt High for the ſlain of the People that are killed all the day long; and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66375:48"/> in this have I believed, that the Lord will hear my Cry, and pity the People that are deſtroyed for lack of Knowledge, that the Witneſs of God in them may ariſe, and that the Priſoner of Hope may come to Deliverance.</p>
            <p>And in this have I not been haſty as to utter their Shame (<hi>for I was my ſelf a Preacher in the Pulpits</hi>) but in a Mournful ſtate oft times many Moneths or Years, have I born this Burden; neither have I now uttered or written this out of Prejudice towards the Perſons of any men, but in the Mournful ſtate of my long burdened and grieved Spirit, from the true ſence of the Sad, Shameful and Miſerable ſtate that is coming upon them, and the Eternal Wo and Miſery that is like to follow after for evermore. The which I deſire they may eſcape by ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the Way that they are in, now it is ſo plainly made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to be ſo exceeding Evil.</p>

               <p>And one of theſe men, who were called from their outward Employment, ſaid, <hi>Every man, wherein he is called, there abide; and whereunto they were called, they did abide,</hi> (and ſo do l) and when the Prieſts and Rulers would have ſtopt their Mouthes by their Commands, they ſaid <hi>Whether it be lawful to hearken unto God or Man, judge ye:</hi> But theſe Miniſters of Chriſt, did not ſay, he that is a Husbandman, there abide; for <hi>Noah</hi> was a Husbandman, yet a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> a Plow-man, and <hi>Amos</hi> a Herdſman; neither did they ſay, He that is a Fiſherman, let him ſo abide; neither did Chriſt ſay, he that will be my Diſciple muſt follow his outward Employment or Trade, but he ſaid, <hi>He that will not hate Father and Mother,

               <p>But hereby, neither Chriſt, nor them Miniſters of his, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did, or do intend to draw or perſwade People to Idleneſs, or open a Door for any ſuch Evil, (neither is there many who are called out of the World's Worſhips, and required to leave their Families and called to the Miniſtry) but that hereby it may plainly appear, that the Command and Call of Chriſt, to his Work and Miniſtry is to be obeyed, though it be to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faking of Houſe, Goods or Lands; for a Miniſter of his, ſaid <hi>We have forſaken all</hi> (And have not I done ſo?) and unto them who had forſaken all, unto all ſuch was promiſed <hi>a Hundred fold,</hi> Matth. 19. 17, 18, 19. <hi>And Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one Jot or Tittle of his Word ſhall fail:</hi> And truly, I have found his Promiſe true, for a Hundred times Hundred ſold have I already received, bleſſed be the Lord forever.</p>
               <p>But how contrary it was to my own Will to fulfill the Will of the Lord. in leaving my Employment and outward Buſineſs in the World, let all them judge with the Light, who knew my Converſation therein, and ſaw my Eagerneſs in the things of the World and Contrivances therein, beyond many men; my Heart being ſet in the Earthly things, being very fierce in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring therein, for the getting and encreaſing of the Fruits of the Earth, as though I would have laid up Treaſure for many Years, which might have been good in its place, if my Mind had been redeemed out of it, and my Heart from the Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof; but I ſay again, it was much contrary to my ſtrong Will, to leave theſe things and the love of them, and much more that might be named, and be taken from it with a Hundred and Fifty Pound loſs, and be expoſed to Want, Hardſhips, Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Impriſonments, Whippings, Stonings, and all manner of cruel Torture, that the Soris of men might have Power to inflict upon my Body, and for me (that ruled over many, and was reſpected by many) to become a Servant unto all, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Off-ſcouring of all, and be abuſed by any Boy, or the Vileſt Perſon I meet; and it was much contrary to my Will, to refuſe that Glory, Honour and Preferment of the VVorld
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66375:53"/> which was offered me by the Rulers thereof, when I was beloved of them, and Hundreds more; and when I preached among them in the Pulpits daily, and was then called of men <hi>Maſter,</hi> like the Hirelings of <hi>England,</hi> who being in the <hi>Curſe cannot ceaſe from Sin, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 14. yet I ſtill refuſed their Unrighteous Gain, and denyed all their Gifts and Rewards; for the Lord, in his Mercy, kept me out of them Temptations, though ſometimes ſome that were then near Friends unto me, would have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to have taken ſomething of what was offered, as to live upon, but I durſt not, if I had wanted Food or Raiment; but anſwered one Juſtice, who was propoſing me a free Gift toward Maintenance, which might have been worth a Hundred Pound a Year, or more, ſeeing I left my Employment, freely to preach daily, but I ſay, I anſwered, <hi>I ſhall rather go in Sheep-Skins and Goat-Skins, and eat Bread and drink Water;</hi> and that little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, meek Principle in me, which then kept me from that (and ſuch Temptations) in due time led me to be Ruler over much, which before I had not Power over; therefore I ſay unto all, it is good to be faithful to the little meaſure of God in the Conſcience.</p>
               <p>For when I was but young and void of the knowledge of God, or his Way of Holineſs, my Mind ran much in the Earth, with a covetous care, how to gain the Riches thereof; and even then did the Hand of the Lord follow me, and his Witneſs in me did ſo judge and condemn me Night and Day for my Evil, that at laſt I was ſcarce able to do any thing in the Earth, or go upon it; &amp; then waiting to ſee what the reaſon was, after many Hours, I ſaw clearly, if I would leave the Wickedneſs of the world, and follow the Lord and truſt him, I might have Peace, and if not, I was like to be cut off: And then I left ſome Sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to live more Holy, and began to Pray and Read, and then I went to follow the Prieſts, not knowing that in me which I was to hear and follow, yet it ſecretly led me out of ſome Evil, and ſo into ſome Peace; and then my Heart was exalted in the Earth, though I encreaſed in a Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>And when I was in the height of the World's Way and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and expecting Riches to increaſe, even then in an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected time, did the dread of the Lord fall upon me, and his wonderful mighty Power wrought exceedingly in me, to break
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66375:54"/> me off from all my Wayes, and ſeperate me from all the Worſhip of the VVorld, and gave me to ſee the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all the Prayers of the Wicked, and the Invalidity of all the Worſhips of all Mankind, who are out of God's Covenant; and the Operations then upon me by the terrible Hand of the Lord, and the ſtrivings that were in me, can never be declared, and then did the Lord command me to follow him in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Will, to declare againſt all Unrighteouſneſs of men, which I ſaw in the Light of Life to be in <hi>Prieſts, Rulers</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> and I then ſaw clearly, in the eternal Light and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of God, the Hardſhips, Cruelties, Whippings, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Dungeon, and many ſuch things, which ſince in part have been upon this Body fulfilled, as may be read in ſeveral of my Books, (read the <hi>True Rule</hi>) and at that time did the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Life of God ſo much break through me, with ſuch unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love, that I was even willing to leave all &amp; walk with God.</p>
               <p>But then contrary to <hi>Paul,</hi> I reaſoned with Fleſh and Blood, that <hi>I ſhould be eſteemed a Mad-man, and that People would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me; and that I was not fit,</hi> (and many ſuch things:) Then the Word of the Lord was ſpoken in me, ſaying, <hi>Who is it that openeth the Mouth? Is it not I the Lord?</hi> Then was my Bowels even turned within me, with the conſtraining Power of Gods Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Love, and I began to be willing; but when that was a little over, the Tempter being near, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reaſoned concerning my Wife and Children, How they ſhould be provided for? and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Promiſe of the Lord was, <hi>That they ſhould be cared for;</hi> and his Promiſe was to me, <hi>That he who converteth Souls to God, ſhould ſhine as the Stars forever:</hi> And when I had received them VVords into me, I was overcome with the Refreſhings of God, and at the preſent made willing to undergo all Tribulations, if in my whole Life I did Convert but one Soul to God, ſeeing and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Redemption of one Soul to be ſo precious, the which then grew ſo ſtrong in me, that I was ſcarce able to retain from preſent actual Obedience to God therein; but when I looked at my outward things, and how firſt to ſettle that in order, then was I by Temptations made afraid, <hi>That it was a Deluſion, or ſomething of the Devil transformed as an Angel of Light;</hi> and then between both, I was in much Trouble and Diſtreſs, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66375:54"/> what to do, having not then known any called <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor any ſuch Operations in any man in thoſe dayes; yet that could hardly prevail to make me believe it was a Temptation: But at laſt, reaſoning about outward things, I then reſolved not to leave them, but to mind the things of the World, and not obey that which called me out of the VVorld.</p>
               <p>And to write in ſhort; at laſt I did ſtrive and joyn with all the Powers of Darkneſs that I could, and uſed all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to drive the Power of God from me, and the Thoughts of him and his Works out of my Mind; but Wo was me after for it, and it had been juſt, if his Spirit had never ſtrived more with me, but left me to be cut off forever, and to remain in the horrible Pit of Darkneſs; (And ſurely it was for the good of others that the Lord did ſpare me, ſome whereof may now with me rejoyce for evermore.)</p>
               <p>For when all was too little to overcome the mighty Power of God in me, then did the love of the World prevail, and even thirſtings, for the love of it to come into my Heart, to drive out the Love of God; at laſt, I with it againſt God prevailed, though the living Power of God was ſo great, that the Devil, the Fleſh and the World was ſcarceable to overcome it for a time; and ſo I have ſeen Children, Wife, Farms and Oxen to hinder from the Kingdom of God; but that which hindred moſt was the love of outward Goods: And ſo it was but juſt with God, to take that at the laſt out of the way; and if he had ſwept all away in his Anger, as from <hi>Job,</hi> he had done me no wrong.</p>
               <p>But when I had thus, in a curſed manner, overcome the ſtriving of the ſweet and lovely Spirit of Truth, yet was I not quiet, but much troubled, and in a ſad Condition, which I was not able to hide from the World, who ſaid, <hi>I was going Mad,</hi> ſeeing me ſo changed into Sadneſs, but of all this, and much more, I durſt not then ſpake a word to any Creature.</p>
               <p>And now mark, what for my Rebellion did juſtly follow:</p>
               <p>My outward Goods, which I then loved more than Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as a Prey and a Spoil to unreaſonable men, and moſt unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their parts, was I by them deprived of it; and the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dried up all my Springs within, that ſuch a time after I knew, that I was left without hope, being in the horrible Pit of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66375:55"/> from God, that I could neither pray nor believe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that I was accurſed from God forever (and that which diſobeyed was accurſed) and being in a ſad miſerable Condition, reſolved to write a VVarning to all People, that they might take Example by me, and never reſiſt the Spirit as I had done; but before I could write (ſinking down into the Condemnation, without Murmuring againſt God, knowing him to be juſt, if he caſt me into the nethermoſt Hell forever) the Lord had Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on me, and liſted my Soul out of the Horrible Pit, and ſtaid me with his hand for a time; yet afterwards his Afflictions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me in Judgments within, and much trouble in things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, which my Heart was ſo upon, and yet for a long time I turned not unto the Lord that did ſmite, that his hand might make whole, though Checks I had by his Light in my Conſcience, but ſtrong was my VVill about it, until the fierce Judgment of the Lord did often break forth upon me with much Aſtoniſhment of Heart, and Horrible Indignation (not to be uttered) with Tears as ſtreams of VVater from mine Eyes night and day, when it came upon me with Tremblings and Breakings, which broke the hardneſs of my Heart, and opened a way to ſomething in me, which then I dearly loved; but going out again from that, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned about my Outwards, and not waiting to receive Counſel from the Lord, I went unto a Rich Underſtanding man in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, whom I loved, who may yet remember, that I made my Complaint unto <hi>That I was not able any longer to abide in the Way of the World;</hi> whoſe Counſel I then took, and my own Will together, and ſo ſought to keep two Kingdoms ſome time longer, and therefore much Trouble followed me within, and VVaſting, Loſs, Shame and Deſtruction upon things without.</p>
               <p>But however, I durſt do no leſs than follow the Lord, and be Obedient unto him, whatever Loſs I ſuffered, or whatever Shame or Reproach I might undergo, though often times I was afraid that this Power of God in me would ſoon come to an end, or fail from me, and that then I might return to my outward Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment with great Shame and Loſs, and that then, inſtead of doing Service for God, I might bring a Reproach upon his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Name, and my ſelf thereby be a Hiſſing-ſtock to all men, and they ſay, <hi>I began to build, and not able to finiſh;</hi> and this alſo kept
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66375:55"/> me back very much. But ſuch was the Everlaſting Love of the Lord, who is known in the Ways of his Judgments, that his Hand was heavy upon me, and his Judgments encreaſed in me, that there was no way for me to eſcape, but I muſt be Obedient, and bow under it, or be cut off forever by it, ſo that my Bowels were often pained in me, and it is like for many Weeks had little ſleep or bodily reſt, and ſometimes knew not my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that I felt and heard in the Bed by me, but thought they were People I ſhould not be with: And therefore one time after it was day, I was riſing and putting on my Clothes in a ſober manner, and in Meekneſs ſaid, <hi>Surely I ſhould not be here;</hi> and my Wife then laying hand on me, eaſily perſwaded me, but I ſaid, <hi>I Know not who I am with;</hi> neither did I know her Voice at that time: And ſome time after, having endured much, I told ſhe and my Family (with Heavineſs and Tears) That <hi>I was not able to enduce it any longer;</hi> and that <hi>I had abode with them in the way of the World ſo long as poſſible I could;</hi> and that <hi>I muſt give up my Life to ſerve the Lord; deſiring them</hi> (with Tears) <hi>to be Content, and in what I could, I ſhould be careful for their good as ever I was:</hi> And this is true, and but little of what might be written.</p>
               <p>For another time formerly, the Light of Chriſt in me (which then I knew not) did ſo condemn me, and judge and trouble me in ſecret, that it brought Sickneſs upon me, and thereby being Weak, expecting I ſhould dye, I was then much troubled, and it lay much upon my Conſcience at that time, that I had not in the time of my Health gone to the Steeple-houſe, and in the fear of the Lord warned all People to Repent; and I was then much grieved becauſe I thought I ſhould dye, and not firſt in that thing diſcharge my Conſcience.</p>
               <p>And ſo, though I might write much, by what is written may appear to the Meek and Sober-minded, that the Lord did not only call, but alſo thruſt me forth of the World into his Harveſt, and this was of God, and the operation of his powerful Word, which called me out of the World, and Hundreds ſince, by the Word of his Power through me have been gathered out of the Way of the World, and received the Earneſt of the Reſt Eternal, and many converted unto God, and Wo be unto them who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe me in this the Lords Work I now am in, which he hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66375:56"/> thus called me unto; and let none think that I did wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect my outward Employment; neither let any one think, that I left my Family, as not regarding them, nor that I ſtay much out of that Country for any By-end; for the words are true, <hi>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is not without Honour, ſave in his own Country, and in his own Houſe;</hi> and thoſe that did ſince ſeek to ſtop my Mouth, did not well.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Concerning my publick Preaching, and ſomething of what followed.</head>
               <p>THAT none may ſtumble thereat, and ſay, <hi>We called</hi> Quakers <hi>are ſuch who change from one thing to another, and ſo what we hold not to be regarded:</hi> But I ſay, Thoſe that have to changes, are not come into fear of God, <hi>pſal.</hi> 55. 19. and <hi>the Fear of the Lord is to depart from Evil: And they depart from Evil are become a Prey; but ſuch were cleanſed and changed from Glory to Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>and grew in Grace and Knowledge in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And what I did or ſaid then, was in a great Zeal and real Intent to do good, neither did I covet mens Silver for it, neither was it my end to make a Gain thereby, though much was freely offered me, more than I intend to make mention, though I recceived it not; ſo that therein I was not much found in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſineſs. But when Judgement came upon me, as before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I gave up that Preaching, and ſaid at the laſt Meeting I had then, which was at <hi>Stoke-bliſs, That my Mouth was ſtopt at that preſent, but if ever the Lord ſhould open my Mouth again, I ſhould Preach indeed;</hi> and it is ſo, Praiſes to the Lord forever, who hath indeed opened my Mouth, (and ſince I was no longer Rebellious) and the living Truth of Juſus Chriſt do I declare, and bear Teſtimony to his Name where-ever I come, as his Spirit moveth me.</p>
               <p>And let none herby think, that I now glory in what was then my ſhame; for though I had a great Zeal then for God, it being not according to the Knowledge of the Crofs of Chriſt, which cruciſies to the World, and all its vain Cuſtoms; the which Croſs being then left behind, which is the Power of God, ſo the Love of the world, which is Enmity to God, remained in me, and the Root Iniquity not them removed out of my Heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66375:56"/> Fruits of Diſobedience in ſecret were ſtill brought forth, which the Would the World took little notice of, but I had one near me, who did let me ſee all that ever I did, and reproved me for vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and having the Praiſe of Men and the Love of the VVorld, and ſo my Preaching did not bring Souls home to God, though I informed their Minds of many things, which many ignorant People knew not before; and ſo though much Love was in many, yet this brought not forth Fruits of Obedience unto God, and ſo all came to little; for the People remained in their Sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not Power to come out of them; neither came they out of the Faſhions and Cuſtoms of the World, nor to the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which purriſies the Heart, ſtands in the pure Conſcience my ſelf: And ſo their Faith and mine was vain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in our Sins.</p>
               <p>Therefore let none think, that I now juſtifie any Deceit, Hy-pocriſie or ſecret Evil, that then was in me, or practſed by me; for in the Preſence of the Lord God I do openly declare againſt it all, and that Spirit that acted me therein (but I own that ſimple thing, which then encourged me to do good, out of an Honeſt Intent, and that kept me out of Covetouſneſs, and from receiving of Gifts.) And I openly declare againſt all Cruel, Unjull and Ungcdly Action and Words and all that Filth which I wallowed in, before I was a zelous Profeſſor, as it is known to may Ungodly Perſons, how I was once as Wicked as many of them, whom I Warn all to Repent, otherwife they cannot eſcape the Dammantion of Hell.</p>
               <p>And I utterly deny, and declare againſt that Blindneſe and Hypocriſie I was in, when I followed the chief Prieſts from one Idols Temple to another, who were chief in the Serpent's Wif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, deceiving me and many more, and taught me that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which came from the Devil, who ſaid, <hi>Te ſhall be a Gods, knowing,</hi> Gen. 3. 5.

                  </gap>orrow, as before was mentioned; for by that Serpent's ſubtilty, which I learned from them without me, I fought againſt and reſiſted that which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66375:57"/> was holy in me: Therefore <hi>I</hi> declare in the Name of the Lord God, that all the Hireling Prieſts do more harm than good, and ſhall never bring People to receive the Power of God, but lead them into Subtilty, and further off from the Knowledge of that of God in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. And as true as the Lord God liveth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Death-beds ſhall both Prieſts and People witneſs this to be true: And its alſo as true, that <hi>I</hi> write this without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to any of their Perſons, but in Love to all Peoples Souls do <hi>I</hi> warn all them Hireling Prieſts in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to leave deceiving the People; for abſolutely the People are deceived by them, and forced to maintain them too, who may be warned of them, by what <hi>I</hi> have learned by Experience from them, having tried them and their ways to the utmoſt, and have much experience of them more than many Country People, whoſe Souls <hi>I</hi> truly love, and therefore this <hi>I</hi> write.</p>
               <p>And I declare againſt that which ruled in me in the time of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Perverſeneſs, and acted me in Cruelty or Oppreſſion towards any Perſon; or to Wrong, Defraud or Inſult over any one in Tyranny, either by Word or Action, or wherein I abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſmote with Envy (which is of the Devil) <hi>Either man or Beaſt,</hi> and that whereby I was led into any manner of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie or Double-mindedneſs, or any manner of Evil whatſoever, which was Unjuſt in the ſight of God, though not ſeen by Man; or any ſecret Evil that then lodged in the dark Corners of the ſtoney Heart then in me, whereby any thing did ariſe in me, or proceed from me, which was contrary to the Humble, Meek, Innocent, Upright Life of the Lamb of God, who is now come and hath <hi>taken away the Sin of the World,</hi> and is Pure, Humble, Meek and Lowly, whoſe Life and Power of Love conſtraineth me to declare openly againſt all that which was done or ſaid by me in Envy, either openly or ſecretly againſt any Creature; for there is nothing done in ſecreet, that ſhall not be made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And let all who knew me before (who are ſaying, <hi>I was an honeſt man, be warned of the like Evil,</hi> and leave it, conſidering, <hi>that if the Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the Ungodly and Sinner appear?</hi> for many did look upon me, to be either a Godly or an Honeſt man, yet am I made willing to let open Shame come
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66375:57"/> upon all that, which then was in me contrary to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; <hi>for he alone is to be exalted, and the Tranſgreſſor is to be aſhamed,</hi> Pſal. 25. 3. And every mouth ſhall be ſtopt, and every one ſtand guilty before God, and the Shame and Nakedneſs of all, both Prieſts, and Fathers, and People ſhall appear as much as mine, when Gods Witneſs in them ariſe, though they cover it for a time by deceitfull Flatteries, Promiſing Liberty, but are as deeply the Servants of Corruption as I was.</p>
               <p>And I do aſſirm in the preſence of the Lord God, that there are a Generation of Profeſſors, who follow Sermons, and have gathered themſelves into outward Forms, who are grown up into a Profeſſion and Knowledge in the Letter, who are further off the Life of God than the Publicans and Harlots, and are grown into Pride, Hypocriſie, ſecret Deceit, Arrogancy and Covetouſneſs; and ſome of them for a time denied the Prieſts, and then for their own ends, got into their places, and ſo are more Abominable than they, and the Tree of Knowledge they feed upon; but the good ſavour of pure Obedience unto God, in all Self-denial, they have caſt behind their backs, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an ill Savour among all men: And the Lord God will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them for theſe things; and in the Day of his ſierce Wrath will all ſuch want a Hiding-place; and when the day of Howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Aſtoniſhment come upon them, as it hath paſſed upon me, then ſhall they know that the Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall be afraid, and Horrible Fearfulneſs ſhall ſurprize the Hearts of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and then ſhall they find, that God will not be mocked, though they deceive themſelves with vain Hopes, which ſhall periſh with all ſuch Profeſſors, if they Repent not, ard ſtrip themſelves bare from all their falſe Coverings, which in the day of the Lord (which they put afar off) will certainly be all too Narrow: For becauſe of the greatneſs of my Profeſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Power that overcomes all Sin, therefore was the Wrath of God the more upon me, and I never came to receive Pardon for Sin nor Power over it, nor to receive the Life of the Son of God, until his Judgments had confounded all that Wiſdom, which I had learned from and among the Prieſts and Profeſſors. And this is abſolutely true, and may be a <hi>Warning</hi> unto all them.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:66375:58"/>
               <p>And all that is herein declared of the Strivings in me, and Judgments of God which came upon me, is very ſhort of what it was, neither indeed, can it be ever declared, being then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded both within and without, not having any man to be a Director unto me, nor then to guide me in <hi>Gods Wiſdom,</hi> neither did any man bring me unto that Condition, nor lead me through it, but even the Lord alone, in whoſe Judgments I now rejoyce for evermore; but this eſpecially, would I have all people that then knew me to conſider, <hi>That at that time,</hi> (when I was in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,) <hi>I knew not well what I ſhould do or ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And ſo, that is true which I have writ in that book in Anſwer to <hi>Edmund Skipp,</hi> wherein I ſaid, <hi>That we were but in meaſure lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the World, and entering into a little of that which is Eternal;</hi> at which time before-mentioned, I was brought to be ſilent from my publick Preaching, and waited on the Lord, with a few fooliſh contemptible Ones in the Eyes of the World, at which time having loſt my Earthly Wiſdom, and not received that meaſure of the pure Wiſdom of God, (which ſince he hath given me) whereby to order all my Words and Actions, in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and Moderation, before the Eyes of all People, and others alſo might then with me therein fall ſhort, whereby ſome to this day may ſtumble at the whole Truth of God, looking at what happened among us, in that time, when the Judgments of God was often on us (by which Judgments, his <hi>Sion</hi> is now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed) and ſo they looking at that, and watch ever ſince for Evil, may be kept thereby from receiving the precious tryed Stone, which the wiſe Maſter-builders alſo refuſe, though we now know, he is laid in <hi>Sion</hi> (redeemed with Judgment, for a <hi>Stone of Stumbling, and a Rock of Offence,</hi> even to both the houſes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> But let all take heed, of ſtumbling at the ſtumbling Stone, (the Light of Chriſt) for other cauſes of ſtumblings, eſpecially by me, I have hereby endevoured to remove out of the way (and minds) of all that are willing to receive the Truth, or believe in the Light, <hi>John</hi> 12. 36.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Edmund Skipp,</hi> if ever he come again to that, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66375:58"/> convinced him of Evil, and made him in publick deny his peaching for Hire and Tythes, though after he ſtrated aſide, and ſtumbled in the Dark, not minding the Light of Life (which once he honeſtly deſired after) in him, to which Light, if he return, and love the Witneſs of God in him, which hath ever ſince ſtood a Witneſs for me, and hath let him ſee his Barrenneſs, and without a true Eternal Reſt, and if he to that be obedient, which is manifeſt of God in him, and by it be led into Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Plainneſs, without Prejudice, he may come to receive the living Truth of Jeſus Chriſt, for which this day I ſuffer Bonds; for I did never yet look upon him to be ſo utterly Reprobate, as not poſſible to receive the Faith that purifies the Heart, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects no mans Perſon; for truly my love hath been to the Seed oppreſſed in him, though that which hath exerciſed him in Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (againſt the Truth of God) I do deny forever; and there is neither him, nor any Prieſt, Preacher, Profeſſor or Profane, that can have any good ground or reaſon to envy me for declaring openly againſt all that in them which I declare againſt in my ſelf, when it ruled in me, when I was as they yet are.</p>
               <p>I being by ſeveral long unjuſt Impriſonments detained from Liberty to declare in words thoſe and other things, therefore for this very end have I written this in ſhort, that God's Truth might ſtand clear, and not ſuffer in any thing done or ſaid by me, before Gods pure Wiſdom was born up in me; and that alſo the ground of all other things againſt the Truth (if occaſioned by me) may be removed out of the Minds of all that are willing to receive the Truth, if they knew it; for I would not, if poſſible, that any thing whatſoever which concerned me, ſhould ſo remain in the Mind of any one, as that thereby he ſhould be hindred from receiving the living Truth, which I have found ſo precious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none can be ſaved: And if by the appearing of the Shame of my former Nakedneſs, an inlet for the Truth may be made into the Minds and Hearts of any, therein will be my Joy, and the Eternal Comfort of all them, who by receiving, and Sanctification of the Truth, and faithfulneſs in the Light, do come to reſt in the <hi>Kingdom of Joy</hi> and <hi>Eternal Peace</hi> forever and ever.</p>

            <head type="sub">Or ſomething in Anſwer to a Book called, <hi>The Duakers Blazing-Star;</hi> Or, <hi>The Worlds-Wonder:</hi> Set forth by <hi>Edmund Skipp,</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>A Preacher of the Goſpel at</hi> Bodenham <hi>in</hi> Herefordſhire. But is ſound and ſeen by the Light of Chriſt, and proved by his own Writings to be out of the Light of the Goſpel, and to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wandered from the Truth, and is now amongſt the reſt of the Wandering Stars, mentioned in <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 13.</head>
            <head type="sub">With a Word to all Profeſſors.</head>
            <p>BEing moved to write ſomething in Anſwer to the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals that have been caſt upon the Truth by <hi>Edmund Skipp,</hi> in a Book called, <hi>The Worlds Wonder,</hi> or the <hi>Quakers
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66375:59"/> Blazing-Star;</hi> whereing he hath not only caſt many Aſperſions upon us, in theſe parts of the Nation, to wit, <hi>Here for dſhire,</hi> but alſo on thoſe, yea, all of the ſame People whom he never ſaw nor heard, whom the great and mighty Power of God hath raiſed by the pure Life of Chriſt in them, to witneſs and live in, which we (here a handful of Babes) are but in a little meaſure yet brought to witneſs; therefore not for our own Vindication, but for the ſimple Ones ſake, who ever were carried away in all Ages with Scribes, Phariſees, falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles, through the ſleight and craftineſs of men, whereby they lay in wait to deceive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>Therefore take notice, that <hi>not many Wiſe men after the fleſh, not many Learned, not many Mighty;</hi> for the Wiſdom of this World paſſeth away, and the Lord is now taking the <hi>Wiſe in their own craftineſs, and chuſing the Fooliſh things of the World to confound the Wiſe,</hi> and the things that are not to bring to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing things that are, <hi>That ſo no Fleſh may glory in his ſight, but that the Lord alone might be exalted,</hi> in this the great day of his Power, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 11. wherein he is riſen out of his holy Habitation, Zach. 2. 13. <hi>to ſhake terribly the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 2. 19, 21. <hi>and bring down the Haughtineſs of man, and lay low the Haughty looks of man,</hi> Iſa. 2. 11. who are going forth like men of War in their own Strength, againſt the Lord, and againſt the anointed, witneſs the laſt page of <hi>Edmund Skipps</hi> Book, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>Now that the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt may the more appear, I ſhall in this following Diſcourſe in brief, lay open ſome of the ſtromer and <hi>yet-lived-in Deceits</hi> of this open Enemy, and alſo ſome of his Lyes, which he hath written againſt the Truth of Chriſt, whom the World knows not; therefore they <hi>write, ſpake, hate, ſtone, whip, impriſon,</hi> and <hi>falſly ſay all manner of Evil againſt us,</hi> wherein the Scriptures are fulfilled by them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11, 12. whoſe Judgment ſlumbereth not, and whoſe Damnation linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</p>
            <p>Now before I proceed further, I give thee a little notice what ſort of people he thus hath opened his Mouth wide againſt, and it ſhall be made manifeſt, and that from his own writings which declare us to be the People of God, choſen out of the world, <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. and he to be the <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> I ſhall give thee a few
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66375:60"/> ſhort hints; but if thou wilt obſerve his Writings, thou wilt find that he himſelf hath declared, that our whole Life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is proved by plain Scripture, and that our Lives and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are the ſame with them that did write and ſpeak forth the Scriptures: But in ſhort, ſee his own words in page 40. <hi>Did you ever know People acted through a more Glorious ſhow or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Righteouſneſs, then they are?</hi> (to wit us) <hi>their denying and throwing off the World, and all care and Pains for Chriſts ſake? their forſaking Father and Mother, and Wife and Children,</hi> Mat. 10. 37. Luke 14. 26. <hi>though with ſo much Affliction, Oppoſition, Perſecution and Diſgrace from men: Is not this like the Croſs of Chriſt, and the Sufferings of Chriſt and his Apoſtles?</hi> (yea even the ſame) <hi>Their traveling ſo many miles from place to place, and ſpeaking ſo boldly unto great men, crying out againſt their Abominations, their writing ſo many Letters, &amp; dealing ſo plainly with men:</hi> (Jer. 18. 18.) <hi>And there are hardly a People to be found, that cry out more againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and all appearance of Sin and Unrighteouſneſs than they do.</hi> And in page 41. <hi>The whole bulk of their actings hitherto, as far as I know, or have heard, do declare them to be carried forth as Miniſters of Righteouſneſs,</hi> page. 44. <hi>for I am perſwaded, they dare not tell a Lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſee plainly, before thou proceed, the Darkneſs, Ignorance and Envy of this man, that can perſecute in writings, and ſmite with the Tongue ſuch a People as he himſelf in this very Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot chuſe but confeſs ſuch things by and in; who that is not altogether blind, will not ſee the Blindneſs, Darkneſs and Ignorance of this mans confuſed Writings?</p>
            <p>See one more page 50. <hi>Now theſe People, as far as I am, and ever was able to diſcern them, are indued with a large meaſure, in thoſe things the Apoſtle mentioned in</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. <hi>I mean, many of them that I know, that I did take, in my former Intimacy and Acquaintance with them, to have received much of the Power of Truth through Chriſts and to have much communion with God, and large experience of his Love: But as for others of them, they were never judged by me or the reſt, to be any more than a willing People; and for ſuch, this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not touch them.</hi> Even by this, (although there might be much more mentioned) thou mayſt ſee in meaſure, in the Light of Chriſt, what he is that doth Rail againſt ſuch a People whoſe Words, Lives, Ways and Actions are agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he confeſſeth in his own Book.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66375:60"/>
            <p>The World loves his own, and the World delights in its own, the World ſpeaketh to the World, and the World hears that which is ſpoken from the Earthly Heart, reacheth the deaf Ear, and no farther; that which is comprehended by the dark Mind, that is ſpoken forth by the deceitful Tongue, that feeds the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that lodgeth in the Hearers; ſo one Darkneſs upholds another, and the ſame Deceit upholds its own in both Speaker &amp; Hearer: So in both Writer and Reader, yea, all that write and ſpeak that which proceeds not from the Life, but from the Death, being in the ſtate of Death, is but Death ſpeaking to Death, whereby Serpents are begotten, or the Seed of the Serpents is encreaſed.</p>
            <p>Now they that are of God, hear God's Word, and they that hear not his Word, are not of God; for the natural man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned by the ſpiritual man that judgeth all things, though no man can judge him who is a Child of the day, and dwelleth in the Light, and hath no fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, out of which the Children of the Day are delivered, and can witneſs the Darkneſs paſt, and the true Light now ſhining in them: But all thoſe who ſay, they have fellowſhip with Light, and walk in Darkneſs, are Lyars, and all Lyars are ſhut out of the Kingdom, and are eſtranged from God, who is altogether Pure, Holy and Righteous, Juſt, Perfect, Light, and thoſe that dwell in him, are as he is, and they only have the Mind of Chriſt, the which all the World and earthly Hearts are ignorant of.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall not put the worldly carnal Heart to judge of what may be written by me, although <hi>I am but yet leaving off the World, and entring into a little of that which is Eternal,</hi> which no Eye of Fleſh can ever attain unto and live; neither can any but thoſe that live in the ſame Life that ſpeaks aright, or underſtands what is ſpoken from the <hi>life,</hi> by thoſe that <hi>ſpake aright</hi> from the pure <hi>life:</hi> Therefore let not thy deceitful Heart deceive thee in judging herein; for the Old Heart is Deceitful, as I ſhall further make manifeſt, both unto the World, and unto the Children of the Light, not only from what I hear, but from his own written words, and my knowledge; and being witneſſed by the Light and Truth, as it is manifeſted in me, whereby ſomething may ſo plainly appear, that even the World it ſelf may ſee the Deceit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66375:61"/> that always hath been, and yet is in this man, who now deſires all the World to take notice (p. 24.) of his Expoſition of his Lyes, that he himſelf hath caſt on us, who are not of the World, therefore the World knows us not; for we witneſs againſt it, that the Deeds thereof are Evil.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Edmund Skipp</hi> had thrown off his Tythes, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of much more, which he was waiting to throw off too, he then told me not long before he leſt us, That he had not Faith to carry him through, neither could he believe; but he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, <hi>That the Devil would ſteal all that he had from him again;</hi> the which is now too true.</p>
            <p>Wo, Wo, Wo, from the Eternal God to all the Inhabitants of the Earth, who dwell in the earthly Darkneſs, being ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Earth, drove out from the preſence of the living God, and are Vagabonds and Fugitives in the Earth, whoſe center is in the earthly dark Mind: Wo to all thoſe that put Light for Darkneſs, and Darkneſs for Light: Wo to all thoſe that go down to <hi>Aegypt</hi> for help in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the pure Seed is captiyated and kept in Bondage; in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> the Lord is daily crucified and put to open ſhame: Wo to all the Oaks of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and all the Beaſts of the Field: Wo to them that build their Neſts among the Stars; for <hi>Capernaum</hi> that is lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in its wiſdom, in its own ſtrength, ſhall be brought down to Hell; for the Lord God of Life and Power is riſen out of his holy Habitation, to confound the Language of <hi>Babel,</hi> and dry up the Tongue of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sea, and famiſh all the gods of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that know not God, whoſe preſence is terrible to all the Children of Diſobedience: Therefore Wo unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker, who ariſeth to ſcatter his Enemies, and to wound the Head of every one that goeth on ſtill in his Wickedneſs. Oh! the Day of the Lord is at hand, wherein <hi>every man ſhall receive according to the Deeds done in his Body;</hi> then he that hath ſeemed to wait, and now begins to ſmite his fellow-Servants, ſaying, <hi>his Maſter delays his coming,</hi> and ſo eat and drink with the Drunken that are drunk indeed with the Wine of the Fornication of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> thoſe are Drunkards indeed, that are drunk with VVine and overcome, but not with ſtrong drink, ſuch ſtagger at the Promiſes, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66375:61"/> ſtumble at the Corner-ſtone; but when that Stone ſhall fall upon them, it will grind them to Powder: Therefore be warned of the Lord, thou that deſpiſeſt and wondereſt (<hi>For all the Works of the Lord are Wonderful</hi>) leſt thou periſh; for the Lord is work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Work in theſe dayes that thou canſt not believe, nor any that live in their own Wiſdom, exalted above the pure <hi>Wiſdom of Chriſt,</hi> who teacheth all his <hi>to deny all,</hi> yea, even <hi>all,</hi> both their <hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Wit,</hi> and all <hi>carnal Comprehenſions;</hi> for they are Followers of him, who lived not in his own Will; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I came not to do mine own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done:</hi> And he that is not yet made a Fool, and ſo denies his own <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> is yet exalted above the Croſs, and the Son of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is exalted above all that is called God, ſitting in the Temple of God, even in the Holy Place, where Truth ſhould alwayes be exalted. Chriſt ſhould reign as King, and ſubdue all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies under his Feet, and lead Captivity Captive, that a Gift may be received, which Gift is <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> and this Life is in the Son; by which Gift, all that are in the Son-like Obedience do witneſs, being made Heirs with him in the eternal Covenant, which is eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes then the firſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he taketh away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond, which is witneſſed in the Son-like Obedience, by the which <hi>we are made the Righteouſneſs of God through him,</hi> the which is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to the dark World, whoſe Mouthes are now open to ſpeak Evil of that they know not, calling the Great and Mighty Works of God, <hi>The Deluſions of Satan,</hi> and the conditions now witneſſed in the Sons and Daughters, that the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles both paſſed through, to ſpeak of thoſe things, they now call <hi>The Works of Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he is an Antichriſt that <hi>denyeth the Father and the Son:</hi> Now ſee who is an Antichriſt; <hi>No man knows the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him:</hi> He that denies this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, denies both Father and Son (that is an Antichriſt.) Now to know the Father, is <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> and he that ſaith, <hi>He knoweth, and hath fellowſhip with the Father, and walketh in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a Lyar;</hi> and the Devil is the Father of Lyes: And he that liveth not in the Truth, which is Jeſus Chriſt, he muſt needs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66375:62"/> Lye, becauſe he is out of the Truth, and therefore found an Enemy to the pure Truth, as it is in Jeſus, who is the Truth and Life it ſelf, by whom the World is, and ſhall be judged, when the Lord ſhall come in flaming Fire, rendering Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on all that know him not: This Day is even at hand, yea, even now the Lord is coming a ſwift Witneſs againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Ones, who hold the Truth of God in Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, living in their ungodly Practices, ſporting themſelves now in the Day-time, ſpending their time upon their Luſts, living in their own Wills, ſpeaking forth the Saints Words, but are Enemies to the Saints Conditions. Oh! conſider, conſider, the Lord is Juſt in all his Wayes, and he is come to judge the Earth with Righteouſneſs, he will plead with all Fleſh, before him all Faces ſhall gather Paleneſs; and in him, who is pure Light, are all the Secrets of all Hearts laid open; for nothing hideth from him, who is a God of conſuming Fire, and of purer Eyes then to behold Iniquity: Oh be aſhamed and confounded, all ye In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth and of the Sea, for the Devil is come down unto you, and rageth, becauſe his time is but ſhort.</p>
            <p>To thy firſt in page 6. where thou ſayeſt, <hi>It muſt needs be the Spirit of Antichriſt and Deluſion, that doth miſ-inform the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> The Heart it ſelf is deceitful, and out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of thy Heart, thy mouth ſpeaketh, page 8. or elſe thou wouldeſt not ſpeak, as though a Deceitful Heart might be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed by a deluſion; for <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Deluſion</hi> is but one, which lodgeth in the Hearts of all the Children of Diſobedience, who are all in the Death, the Curſe and the Fall, unleſs they come to witneſs Reſtoration, the Stoney Heart taken away, and a New Heart given, which is by the putting off the Old Man with his Luſts and Corruptions, and the New Man put on, which <hi>after God is created in Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the Light in thy own Conſcience, ſee when ever thou couldeſt witneſs thy Redemption, and thy heart free from Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as thou ſpeakeſt, or from the power of Darkneſs, when thou by thy own Relation to me, went from one Parſonage to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and that not without thy Gown (as thou calleſt it) upon thy back, that thou haſt looked upon as it was indeed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66375:62"/> and then after at <hi>Bodinham,</hi> thou didſt ſue the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for Tythes, to my knowledge, witneſs one poor man thou didſt ſue for one Shilling, and wouldſt have conſtrained the poor man to have paid Charges for that one Shilling, if I and ſome other had not ſpoke to thee, after thou hadſt often refuſed the one ſhilling without Charge, though the Light let thee ſee. Tythes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſt, yet then lived contrary to the Light in thy own Conſcience, as thou waſt made to confeſs in my hearing, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds more, that thou hadſt acted in it contrary to thy Conſcience two years; and before that time thou didſt confeſs unto me, and to others; <hi>How thou waſt going to take counſel of men, how to ſue for thy Tythes, and the Lord met with thee, yet the Devil had like to have taken thee off of the work of the Lord again,</hi> divers times, as thou confeſſedit, <hi>Then thou layeſt groaning under the burden of thy Tythes; yet thou reſolvedſt to keep them another year,</hi> yet I had thoughts to the contrary, and was made to tell thee at <hi>J. B</hi>'s houſe in <hi>Hereford,</hi> on the ſixth day, <hi>that thou wouldeſt e'er long roar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy Tythes like a Lyon;</hi> and on the next firſt day after it was ſo, and thou waſt made to acknowledge the Lord in it, and ſent thy Man with thoſe few words to me; <hi>Brother</hi> Smith, <hi>the Lord hath done a ſtrange Work in me this Morning, and I ſhall alter ſtrangely this day therefore pray earneſtly for me and make what haſte thou canſt to come unto me.</hi> Now this is that which thou now calleſt <hi>Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> for this was the greateſt Power that ever thou couldeſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but thou waſt made to ſee by the Light, the Emtineſs of thy own words, both in Speaking and Prayer before, as thou calleſt it; witneſs that in <hi>Margarets</hi> Grave-Yard, where thou ſpokeſt words, the which were a burden to thy Life, &amp; after acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt, <hi>That it was nothing but Fleſh, though thou didſt ſtrive much in thy own ſtrength:</hi> And at <hi>Len.</hi> thou toldeſt the whole Aſſembly, <hi>That thou hadst long ſpoke after the manner of men; but now they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no more ſuch from thee;</hi> and that <hi>thy Praying was as dead as Ditch-Water; but now thou ſhouldſt wait to Pray in the Spirit, and ſpeak by the Spirit;</hi> and the like at <hi>Cliſton:</hi> And then thou waſt convinced, that thou muſt leave all, even Glebe-land too, and ſo live on thy own Land, and build on thy own Land, as thou calleſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66375:63"/> it; and thou then waſt convinced of more Deceit in thy Heart; therefore thou waſt not at all freed from Deceit, but always lived in the Antichriſtian ſtate, where thou art yet, witneſs thy own hand in page 5 where thou confeſſeſt, <hi>Thou haſt got a ſinful Heart;</hi> which is a Heart in Sin, and full of Sin; and we know, that <hi>none but the Pure in Heart ſhall ſee God;</hi> but <hi>Sin is of the Devil, and is the Work of Darkneſs; and none that walk in Darkneſs have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God,</hi> 1 John 1. 6. Here thou diſcovereſt plainly, that the Old Heart is not yet taken away; therefore thou waſt not at all, nor yet is free from Deluſions: Therefore for ſhame leave off thy judging the Hearts of of others, as thou haſt; read <hi>E.

O Praiſes, Praiſes be unto him who hath redeemed us out of the Nations, Kindreds and Tongues, to ſerve the living God in Newneſs of Life, and not in Oldneſs of Letter, that ſo now we may offer up eternally living and eternal Sacrifice and Praiſe for evermore, who hath in meaſure redeemed us from the World, and out of all Darkneſs that is therein, and hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son, and made us Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, which is the Eternal Light of Life; for God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all; and all thoſe that live in him, are the Children of the Day, who walk in the Day, even the pure Light, in the which there is no occaſion of ſtumbling, our Feet being guided in the Path of Peace, which is the true and living way, in which the way faring man, though a Fool ſhall not Err, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 8. which is the pure way of Holineſs, leading up into the full Enjoyment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who hath long waited to be gracious unto us; and now in the Day of his Love and Power hath gathered us in his Arms of Love, and brought us home unto himſelf, who were before the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wandering with you from Mountain to Hill, but did not find Reſt unto our Souls; but now the great and mighty Power of the Lord hath raiſed up his own Seed in us, to cry <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah</hi> unto him; to whom alone be all Honour, Glory and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Eternal Praiſes forever, even forever and ever; for he that was loſt is found, he that was dead is alive, and behold he liveth for evermore.</p>
            <p>Now my Friends, the whole World lieth in Wickedneſs, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66375:69"/> all the World by Wiſdom knows not God; the natural man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of God, which are hid from the Wiſe and Prudent, even from the Readers of the Scripture, from Scribes, Phariſees, Prieſts, yea, the Princes of this World; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory, who is crucified daily by the ſame ſpirit that now ruleth in the Children of Diſobedience, even in the Scribes, Prieſts and People, that live in the ſame Nature, where the learned Ones of the World are, and all thoſe that walk in Darkneſs, to wit, Pride Covetouſneſs, Love of the World, Hatred, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, Strife, Sedition, Hereſie, Backbiting, Heady, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of God, Scoffers, walking after their own Ungodly Luſts, Raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own Shame, who account Gain Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe Eyes are full of Adultery, Feet ſwift to ſhed Blood, Ears open to all deceit, whoſe Mouthes are full of Curſing and Bitterneſs, the Poyſon of Aſps is under their Lips, their Throats are an open Sepulcher, who imagin Miſchief, their Hearts being altogether Deceitful and deſperately Wicked: Such as theſe are the Fruits of the Fleſh, in the which all the World lies; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I witneſs againſt the World, that the Works thereof are Evil.</p>
            <p>Now in the world there are <hi>Sects, Schiſmes, Judgments</hi> and <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> there they are heaping up Teachers to themſelves, having itching Ears, and according to the number of their Fanſies, ſo are their wayes of Worſhip; according to the number of their Imaginations, ſo are their gods; <hi>for there are many gods, and many Lords, but the living God is not known by the World; for it by Wiſdom knows not God: No man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son revealeth him:</hi> Now he that hath the Son revealed in him, <hi>is born of God,</hi> and <hi>he that is born of God overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the World, and ſinneth not; He that ſinneth, hath not ſeen him:</hi> But this is a hard ſaying, who can bear it? the World cannot; for the World hears its own; <hi>they that are of God, hear Gods Word;</hi> ye hear them not, therefore ye are not of God.</p>
            <p>Now Friends, all you that have looked after me, and other men, for teaching, now I can write unto you what I know, that it is the Lord alone, that teacheth his people to profit, none
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66375:69"/> teacheth like he, who is now my Teacher indeed, and will be yours if you are made willing and obedient to be taught, directed and guided by him, who is gathering his out of all Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and Tongues, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31. 11. which is by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the one</hi> and only Prieſt, who is the Light of the Gentiles, and the light of the World, by which he hath enlightened every one that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. which light ſhineth into the Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. Now the World is ſet in the heart of man, <hi>eccleſ.</hi> 3. 11. Of the which World, Chriſt is the Light, <hi>and he that followeth him, ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but ſhall have the Light of Life,</hi> John 8. 12. This is that <hi>Grace of God that hath appeared unto all men, teaching them to deny Ungodlineſs, and Worldly Luſts, and live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. This is the Light of Chriſt, who is the Word of God in the Heart; for his Word of the living God is not far off, but <hi>it is nigh thee, in thy Heart and in thy Mouth, that thou mayeſt do it,</hi> Deut. 30. 14. Now therefore, Friends, look not forth after them that ſay, <hi>Chriſt is here, or there;</hi> for they are all Deceivers: The Word is nigh, the Light is within thee, even in thy Dark Heart, although thy Dankneſs cannot comprehend it, becauſe thou loveſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather then the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, which ſhineth in thy Conſceince, and lets thee ſee the evil of thy Wayes, and calls thee to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to forſake the Wicked, and live: This is the Talent that thou art hiding in the Earth; for the which thou muſt give an Account; therefore ſay I unto thee, mind that Teacher that teacheth to deny Ungodlineſs, and this is the Light to Jeſus Chriſt in thy Conſcience, the which Light proceedeth from Chriſt, and leadeth all that love it (<hi>John</hi> 8. 12.) up to Chriſt, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life, the only Way, and no other way to the Father.</p>
            <p>Now all of you owning this VVord, and Teacher, and Light in your own Conſciences, you will come to witneſs Jeſus Chriſt in the Light of Life, and know him to be the way unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which leads out of the Darkneſs of all the VVorld's Ways, VVorſhips, Forms, Faſhions, Cuſtoms, VVords, VVayes and Actions, and come to be gathered in the Light unto Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Light, and from the Light then to come to witneſs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66375:70"/> the Scriptures to be true, yea, even fulfilled in you by the ſame Spirit as it was in them that did write and ſpeak forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo witneſs with them againſt the ſame things that were witneſſed againſt then, by the Children of the Light, who had fellowſhip with the Father, by the which they ſaw that which in meaſure I witneſs, that there is but <hi>one Way, one Truth, one Light one Faith, one Baptiſm, one Spirit, one Head, one High Prieſt,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever liveth to make interceſſion for us, <hi>one Church</hi> of the firſt-born, whoſe Names are written in Heaven, <hi>one God</hi> over all, who is Rich unto all that call upon him in Spirit and Truth, the which Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers the Father ſeeketh to Worſhip him, who is a Spirit, and all his Worſhips are <hi>Spiritual;</hi> but God hears not Sinners; and he that regardeth Iniquity in his Heart, the Lord will not hear him; for there are none but the pure in heart that ſhall ſee God, whoſe Preſence is Terrible to all the Workers of Iniquity, that continue in the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Now all of you, ſee that you keep unto the true Guide, which is Jeſus Chriſt, and follow him, and ſee that you do not turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Vomit, as the manner of ſome is, who begin in the Spirit and end in the Fleſh: Oh! leave all for Chriſt, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve two Maſters; you cannot be of the World, and of God, you muſt witneſs a Separation: Therefore in Love to all your Souls, that have been Profeſſors with me in publick, in theſe parts of the Nation, and all others, flatter not your ſelves in your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, promiſing your ſelves Liberty, whilſt you are the Servants of Corruption; therefore forſake the Wicked, and live.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>my Friends,</hi> and all <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> marvel not at my Change; for the Wicked have no Changes; therefore they fear not God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 19. but I am made to witneſs the fear of the Lord to be the beginning of Wiſdom, the which Wiſdom is pure, which cometh down from above, <hi>James</hi> 3. 17. which none of the Princes of this World know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. therefore they call the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Chriſt <hi>Madneſs, Acts</hi> 26. 24. for the preaching of the Croſs of Chriſt is to the <hi>Joros</hi> a Stumbling-block, to the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fooliſhneſs; for Chriſt is this day, as he was ever, a Stone of ſtumbling, and a Rock of offence to both the Houſes of <hi>Iſrael, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 13. therefore are they this day ſpeaking Evil of that

But in the Way that men call Hereſie, do I Worſhip the God of my Father, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 14. and am not aſhamed to own the Power that ſhakes the Earth; for if I ſhould be aſhamed to own the Power of Chriſt before men, then he might juſtly be aſhamed of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Father which is in Heaven; but I own and witneſs the ſame Power which made <hi>Moſes</hi> exceedingly fear and quake. The which overpowered <hi>Daniel,</hi> that he had no ſtrength left in him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 8. Which Power made <hi>Habakkuk</hi> Tremble, his Lips Quivered, Rottenneſs entred into his Bones, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 16. the which Power ſtruck down <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. 3, 4, 5, 6. which cauſed the Goaler to come in <hi>Trembling, Acts</hi> 16. 26, 27, 28, 29.

            <p>THE Day of Gods Everlaſting Love is come, and with his Mighty Power is he riſen to gather all them in the Light of his Son, that long have ſate in Darkneſs, and in the Shadow of Death, upon whom the Day is now Dawning, wherein the Outcaſts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be gathered, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that long have groaned may now come to know Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for with plentious Redemption is the Lord viſiting his People, and he is coming near unto his own, and ſeeking them that are afar off, and lifting up a Standard for the Standard for the Strangers to flow unto, and many ſhall return unto the Lord, and People ſhall be gathered to the God of their Salvation, and he will pour out his Spirit upon the Humble, and fill the Meek with the Riches of his Love; Multitudes of People ſhall come unto <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Poor of the Flock to the City of the great King; for Light is breaking forth as the Morning, and Righteouſneſs as the Sun at Noon; therefore ſhall the <hi>Mourning Seed</hi> be comforted, and that which groaned in Captivity lift up the Head, that the Priſoner may ſpring forth of Bondage, and the longing Soul be ſatisfied, and Judgment come upon the Wicked, and Terror upon the Lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man, the Rebellious brought down to the Duſt, and that which boweth not unto the Light, with it is condemned forever, that through the Condemnation the Seed may ſpring, which long in Death hath lain, and is now to be raiſed up by the Arm of God's Almighty Power, which now comes to be revealed unto them who believe the Voice of the true Spirit, which is in the midſt, whom all are to hear, and obey his voice, who comes out from God, and leads them that believe in and obey him up unto God again, and he is the only Way unto the Father, by

            <p>For the Lord our God is pure, his living Truth is to be known in the inward parts, and that which makes Free received in the Heart; and pure is the Lord in his Miniſtration of Life, and free in the Diſcoveries of his Love; his unſearchable Riches are made known unto his Jewels, and his Secrets revealed unto them that abide in his Fear, whoſe Fear is a Fountain of Life, whoſe Love is ſtreaming forth as a River of Oyl unto the broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in him the Fatherleſs find Mercy, and he giveth ſtrength unto the Faint, he cheriſhed the Babes as a Nurſe, and feedeth the Young with Milk, he gathereth the Lambs with his Arms, and

            <p>And my dear Lambs, grieve ye not the Spirit of the Lord, neither be you Envious againſt the Evil-Doers; let not Wrath ariſe in any one of you, but be Examples of Love and Meekneſs, one unto another; and all come to know what a true waiting upon the Lord is, in the Sincerity of the Heart, to receive that which the World never knew, even the Spirit of Truth, which comes from the God of Peace, in which the Bleſſing is received, and leads in the way of Righteouſneſs, and will joyn your Hearts together, in the Everlaſting Covenant of the Father, which he is eſtabliſhing with all his faithful Ones, among whom you may now come to be gathered, and find an eternal Inheritance with them that are ſanctified, who come to be made one with him that ſanctifieth, who now cometh to purge away the filth, and cleanſe that which hath not been cleanſed, that Sinners may be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, and the Filthy redeemed from their filthineſs, before the day come, wherein it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>He that is Filthy, let him be Filthy ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, let the Day of your Viſitation be dearly prized, knowing that God, who is Light, will not alwayes ſtrive with man; and its his Everlaſting Love in that he hath viſited you, and paſſed by the Wiſe and the Mighty, and made your Hearts ſometimes ſoft and tender, by the powerful Drawings of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Love, which by your Obedience and Belief in the Truth, comes to be more and more ſhed abroad in your Hearts, which Love will conſtrain Obedience to the Light, in which Light Gods Power is received, which Power maketh Sons, who cry, <hi>Father</hi> unto him that begeteth after his own Image, whoſe Image comes to be renewed in the Children of the Light, which <hi>Light</hi> is now come, and we are Witneſſes of it, and teſtiſie what we have ſeen, and declare unto you the Meſſage that was from the beginning, and ſo preach not another Goſpel unto you, but the ſame, which is the Power of God, which I neither receive of men, nor learn of men, but by Revelation, in which the Father

            <p>Therefore, <hi>Friends,</hi> wait on the <hi>Lord,</hi> that you may come to reap the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs, which in due time comes to be brought forth in all them that faint not: And take heed of ſeeming to be what you are not; for all Proud Boaſters are for the <hi>Lake.</hi> Take not Counſel of the Serpent, neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the carnal Thoughts for the Morrow; be watchful in all Diligence, that you may know Gods Work wrought in you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Night comes, in which none can work: Therefore be not Idle, Sloathful nor Negligent; for the <hi>Lord,</hi> who is <hi>Love,</hi> will not alwayes wait upon ſuch to be gracious; yet they that Honour him through Obedience, he will Honour; but they that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed: Thoſe that obey him, he honoureth in his <hi>Love,</hi> and the Diſobedient he leaves in a Bed of Torment.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66375:79"/> and comes to clothe the Naked with the Righteouſneſs of his Son for his Spirit reacheth unto that which is in Want, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is extended to the Lowly in Heart, which long breathed after Life and Power to overcome the Evil, but knew not the way to obtain it; and therefore in the reſtleſs Wilderneſs, under the burden of Sin, did long Travail, as in a weariſom Land of Darkneſs, having little hope towards God, being often in much Diſtreſs, when no Eye pitied, even then had the Lord Mercy for his own Name ſake, and he remembred his Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> his Friend, and had Compaſſion on the Seed of the barren Womb, which was as the Root of a Plant hid in a dry Land, whom the Lord came to viſit in the Power of his Infinite <hi>Love,</hi> and ſaid to the dead, <hi>Live forever,</hi> which Word of Power reached through the Earth, making way through it unto the Seed, that it through the Earth, making way through it unto the Seed, that it through the Earth might ſpring (by the Virtue of his <hi>Life</hi>) as a <hi>Lilly in the Spring,</hi> that ſo the Priſoner might grow up out of Captivity, and receive the early and the latter Rain, and the Dews of Heaven, that as a tender Plant it may grow, and become as a Tree, and be fruitful as a Vine, bearing much Fruit over the Earth. Oh! the Infinitneſs of the Fullneſs of the Fountain of the <hi>Father's</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible <hi>Love</hi> unto the Priſoners of Hope, and the captivated Seed of <hi>Iſrael!</hi> Who can declare his Mercy to the Afflicted! or utter his Bowels of Compaſſion to the Spirits in Priſon? What Tongue can declare the unſearchableneſs of his Way of Life, or make known the Infiniteneſs of that which paſſeth Knowledge? He hath been a Father to the Fatherleſs, he hath given <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to them that ſate in Darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death; he is found of them that ſought him not, he ſpreadeth forth his Arms to gather them that asked not for him; he giveth Gifts to the Rebellious, and he is grieved with thoſe that receive not the Tenders of his <hi>Love,</hi> and complaineth (from the grief of his Soul) when <hi>Iſrael</hi> will have none of him: He delighteth not in the Death of the Wicked, but waiteth long for their Return. If <hi>Iſrael</hi> backſlide, yet afterwards return with true Repentance, forſaking the Evil, he ſheweth Mercy, even to the Prodigal, and he heals the Backſlidings, and loves them freely, that none may ſay, their Deſtruction is from him, nor that he appointed them thereunto, nor charge him with Injuſtice in the day of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66375:80"/> when the Juſt ſhall ariſe to the Reſurrection of <hi>Life,</hi> and the Unjuſt to the Reſurrection of <hi>Condemnation</hi> forever, that every Moath may be ſtopped, and every one ſtand Guilty before the Throne of his Judgment, and every Tongue confeſs to God, <hi>That he is Righteous in all his Wayes, and that all his Judgments are Just and True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And out of his Fatherly Pity, from the freeneſs of his <hi>Love</hi> hath he viſited many of you, even with a Meſſage of <hi>Life</hi> and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Word of his Power, making known that unto you, which hath been hid from Ages and Generations, and is yet hid from all <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> Princes and <hi>Nimrods</hi> Builders, yea, even from all the Wiſe and Prudent of the Earth, even that is he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing to many of you, who are willing to become Fools and ſuffer the loſs of all for his ſake, who ſaves the Soul, and that not for any Works of Righteouſneſs which you have done, but of his own free <hi>Love,</hi> through the Power of his Immortal Word is he begetting Sons and Daughters to himſelf, that he alone might be honoured, who worketh all their Works in them, that his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip all ſuch might be created a new in Chriſt Jeſus <hi>unto good Works</hi> in them, to walk in <hi>Newneſs of Life,</hi> bringing forth Fruits unto God, who with the Light of his Son, <hi>in whom he is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> hath convinced many of you of the Evil of your Ways, and the Blindneſs you were in, when you were <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> even as others; and his <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> hath ſhined in you, to let you ſee the want of a Saviour, and feel the burden of your Sins, that the Word of Repentance you all might receive, and come to be led by him whom God the Father hath ſealed for a Covenant of his Eternal <hi>Love,</hi> and ſent for a <hi>Light,</hi> to be a <hi>Leader</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and a <hi>Deliverer</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to inherit the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and poſſeſs the utmoſt parts of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that the Brightneſs of his Power might ſhine over all the World, and the ſound of his Voice be heard to the utmoſt parts of the Earth, that the Outcaſts of the Earth might be brought to the one Fold, and the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> be gathered from the four Corners of the Earth, that Redemption might be known, from under the Shadow of Death; and that the blind, which have Eyes, and the deaf, which have Ears, might come forth to the <hi>Light</hi> of the Son, who looſeth the Tongue of the Stammerer,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66375:80"/> that it may ſpeak plain, that thoſe who Err in Judgment might learn the Doctrine of the Son of the Father's Love, who comes to lead the blind by a way they know not, and lead them in Paths that they have not known, and with Weeping and with Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth he lead them that walk in the ſtrait and narrow Path of Life, where thoſe that abide in the Fear ſhall not ſtumble, but walk in the Uprightneſs of Innocency, through the Power of the Father's Love, continuing in the way of Holineſs, where only the Ranſomed of the Lord do walk, the which Way of Holineſs the Lord God hath made known to many, which reached unto your Hearts, whereby it was at the preſent made ſoft and tender, and you received the Truth with love, rejoycing that you came to find the way to Eternal Peace, and many began to ſay one to another, <hi>This is the Way, let us to walk in it;</hi> and for a time many walked in Humility, and pure, dear and tender Love began to ſpring up in you one to another, and the Enemies of your Souls began to be ſubject to you, and the tenders of God's Love was over you, to do you good at your latter end; but behold, before you came to the Land of Reſt, the Lord tryed you, by ſuffering the Enemy to preſent Hardſhip, Straits, and many Difficulties to come; on the other hand, to preſent the Glory of the World, and the Favour of great Men; and ſome, the Enemy draws forth their Minds from the Strait and narrow Way, into carnal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Eaſe in the Fleſh, and ſo to contain an Eaſier way, whereby the simplicity in many is betrayed into the Power of the man of Sin, who worketh ſtrongly to keep his hold in one Deceiveableneſs or another, to keep in Bondage the Life of the JUST, to keep his Head from being bruiſed by the Power of the Seed of the Promiſe, which under the Subtilty in many hath cryed for Vengeance upon the Head of that which Murders the Just; and when times of Tryal come by Judgment, and Famine and Want have come upon others, then have they ſtarted aſide like a broken Bow, and cauſed th Offence of the Croſs to ceaſe, and then hath Unbelief come in, and the Enemy cauſed Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the living Truth, and Conſultations about the Way of Life, and ſuch grew weary of their Tryal, like their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Wilderneſs, even letting the Enemy draw back their Hearts to the Fleſh Pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which God by his mighty
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66375:81"/> Power had redeemed them from, and was leading them by the right Hand, and in the narrow Way that they ſhould go: And others, the Enemy (who ſtill ſeeketh to devour the begotten of God) hath drawn forth their Minds into a ſottiſh careleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not regarding the ſtirrings of Gods Spirit with them, by the Light of his Son in their Hearts; and ſo not minding that his Spirit will not alwayes ſtrive with them, and having ſeen before the ſtraitneſs of the Way, the Enemy will work by all Subtilty to keep ſuch from it, and from the Meetings and Society of them that in the ſtrait Way abide, keeping them ſtill from the Croſs, which would be his Death, and the Life of that which would give Peace, and Victory over him and all his Wiles. And others coming to ſee that they are come ſo far, ſo that they need not Words, nor any man to teach them, then hath the Enemy invited them to ſit down at eaſe; and ſo not minding the continual fear, at laſt they loath the Manna, and call it <hi>Dry,</hi> whereas the drineſs and barrenneſs comes by reaſon of their Unfaithfulneſs in not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving what they had through their continual watchfulneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the daily Croſs. And the Enemy geteth forth the Mind of others to watch for Evil, or at leaſt, to look at the Temptations, Backſlidings, Backwardneſs and Failings of others, more than their own Conditions, (who ſee their own Evil therein) ſome whereof thereby at laſt draw back others, queſtion the Truth it ſelf; and by ſuch things as theſe the Simplicity in many other tender Lambs is burdened &amp; grieved, and the Life preſſed down, by which they ſhould grow and be fruitful unto God. And others being convinced with the pure Light of ſomething that is Evil, which ſeemeth little to the carnal Eye, and ſo going out from the Obedience to the Light, and conſult and reaſon, and take Counſel of the Serpent, who then contrives a way to ſhun the Croſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo endeavour to dawb the thing over from a ſecret Deceit, working in the Power of Darkneſs, until the Light hath even ceaſed ſtriving with that Perſon, and then he goes on with the thing, ſaying, <hi>He hath liberty therein.</hi> But let ſuch mark and obſerve themſelves; for no more unto them is committed, neither do they grow or come any further, but there ſtand as dry Plants, coming long to Meetings, having the Form, but not feeling the Power; for ſuch who knowingly deny their Obedience in any
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66375:81"/> thing to the Light of Chriſt, he will deny them his Power in all things.</p>
            <p>And thus doth and will the Enemy of your Souls make havock of the Flock, if in the pure humble fear he be not alwayes watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, and ſlain by the Power of the Croſs in the Light; and many other Wiles and Ways doth the Enemy of your Souls watch to devour, enſnare and overcome you; the time would even fail one to declare it; the Lord God Almighty help you againſt it, that ſo in the Light you may ſee all theſe, and many more things, which you are all to Watch and War againſt, that Spiritual Wickedneſs in High-places may not overcome you, and that you may not turn aſide with the Error of the Wicked, nor be overcome with the power of Temptations, but that you may be all diligent and watchful againſt every appearance of your Enemy, and be able to ſtand in the day of Tryal, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of your Souls prevail not.</p>
            <p>Therefore, all <hi>Friends</hi> every where, keep upon your Watch, let the Light ſearch your Hearts, and keep your <hi>Meetings</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſilent fear and dread of the Lord, that his Power in you all may raiſe you all in the Dominion and Wiſdom of God to ſtand and feel that which keeps your Hearts together in the unlimitted Love of God, and ſo his preſence you will be fruitful unto his Bleſſing come to receive, whereby you will be fruitful unto him in every good Word and Work.</p>
            <p>The living Power of my Father preſerve you all from the Power of the Enemy, and keep your Minds in that which croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth your Wills, that the Lord God of Life may watch over you all for good for evermore.</p>

            <p>JUBAL was the Father of all ſuch as handle the Harp and Organ, and ſo the Father of all ſuch Muſitioners, being himſelf of the Seed of <hi>Lemach,</hi> who ſlew a man; and ſo the Son of a Man-ſlayer was the Father of all ſuch as handle the Harp and Organ: And the Man Chriſt, the Light, is the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World. And <hi>Jubal</hi> was of the Generation of <hi>Cain,</hi> who firſt ſlew a Man, and then built a City; he ſlew his Brother, one that was near unto him; and the Light of the Lamb ſlain is near unto every one, even that which comes from the Man of Sorrows is in the Heart; <hi>Cain</hi>'s Seed ſlayes the man of Sorrows; the Muſitioners were of <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſeed: And that which ſlayes the man of Sorrows, invents, ſets up and delights in the Inſtruments of Muſick; and the Father of all ſuch was <hi>Jubal,</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Cain,</hi> who built a City, and ſo

            <p>And they who danced in the wilderneſs, and ſung and made a great noiſe, and were in the Mirth and Vain Delights, were a ſtiff-necked People, and ſuch as ſate down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play, like the ſame Generation now, who are ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked, and bow not to him, who is the Light, low in the Heart, to whom every knee ſhall bow, but eat and drink, and riſe up to vain delights, having Muſick at their Feaſts, ſeeding themſelves without fear, <hi>Jude</hi> 12. like <hi>Jezabel,.</hi> (at whoſe Table the falſe Prophets feed) who made a Feaſt, when ſhe intended to murder the Righteous, to gain his Poſſeſſion (read within) and that which Murders the Juſt; and ſuch who forget God, delight in theſe things; for they that ſung and danced in the Wilderneſs, forgot the mighty Power of the Lord which brought them out of Bondage, therefore they got into the carnal Liberty, like many others at this day, before they come to the true Reſt; and theſe were in the falſe Worſhip, who Worſhip that which the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eye might perceive, and theſe had loſt the true Guide: And when they were in their ſinging and dancing, they knew not what

            <p>And when them in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had Harps (the Muſitioners) them who delighted in Muſick were carried Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Land of Confuſion, in which Land <hi>Nimrod</hi> the mighty One in the Earth went hunting before the Lord, and by the River of <hi>Babylon</hi> they ſate down and wept, who were before the <hi>Muſition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> with their Harps; theſe went into Captivity becauſe of the Sin, and hanged their Harps upon the Willowes, and ſate down Mourning by the Rivers of Babylon; and that which delighted in the Muſick cauſed the Captivity, and leads into Bondage that which ſhould come to Liberty, whereby Sorrow, Weeping and Mourning comes in the End; for the Songs of the Temple is to be turned into Howling, and their Delight in the Muſick was turned into Weeping, and they led captive from <hi>Zion,</hi> who were come to the land of Promiſe, and there took Liberty in theſe fleſhly Delights, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 137.

            <p>And therefore it is this day that the <hi>Governors,</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> the <hi>Treaſurs,</hi> the <hi>Counſellors,</hi> the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,</hi> and all the <hi>Rulers in the Earth,</hi> who are of <hi>Babels</hi> ſtock, and of their Fathers, <hi>Cain, Lamech</hi> and <hi>Jubal,</hi> are joyning together to <hi>perſecute</hi> them that <hi>Worſhip God in Spirit,</hi> who commanded not to bow down or worſhip any Image or Likeneſs; and ſo their Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are denyed, the Subſtance being come, and Chriſt reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within, who is a man of Sorrows, who ſaid, <hi>The World ſhould rejoyce,</hi> John 16. 20. <hi>But their joy ſhould be turned into ſorrow;</hi> and his Light in the Conſcience is it which judgeth thoſe vain Delights in carnal Muſick, which is to periſh with the uſing.</p>
            <p>For when the Spirit was departed from <hi>Saul,</hi> he ſought for one to play upon a Harp before him, and for a time he was ſatisfied with that, and when he heard the Muſick, he would be well, but afterwards his delight in the Muſick could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that Murthering Spirit in him, but at the very time that <hi>Saul</hi> heard the Muſick he ſought to ſlay him that was to be King; and ſuch as <hi>Saul,</hi> who reject the Counſel of God, ſlayes him that is the <hi>Light,</hi> and would not that he ſhould reign, who is a man of Sorrows; and he that loved the Muſick, had an evil Spirit, or ſomething that troubled him, and that which moved in him, while he heard the Muſick, to murther that which was to Reign, (the Lords Anointed) the ſame thing led him to the Witch; And ſo firſt he left the Spirit of God, then ſought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They follow Witchcraft, who obey not the <hi>truth,</hi> which makes Free; and he that is the Light, is the Truth, and the Lamb ſlain, by that which takes delight in that, which is out of the Truth, invented by the Generation of <hi>Cain,</hi> a Fugitive in the Earth, of whom his deceived Mother ſaid, <hi>I have gotten a

            <p>And <hi>Solomons</hi> Wives, his Men-Singers, Women-Singers and Inſtruments of Muſick drew away his Heart from the Lord; and after he cryed againſt the Vanity of theſe things; for it leads out from the Spirit (and fear) of the God of order within, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the confuſed things without, and ſuch as follow that, are of <hi>Babel,</hi> the Mother of Harlots, who hath made all Nations drunk, in whom the time is come, that the Voice of Harpers and Muſitioners ſhall be heard no more at all; for the Foundation and Skirts of that great Whore and her Craftsman are diſcovered with the Light, which judgeth theſe things.</p>

            <p>Therefore all ye Wiſe and Prudent, Ancient and Honourable, Devout, Zealous and Religious Ones, let all your Minds be turned from the Varieties of Conceptions in the vain Imaginations, and the vain Thoughts of the dark Mind, which leadeth forth into the carnal Conceivings of things, without the pure Subſtance of the one Immortal Life, which in man lies hid, from all that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom which naturally ruleth in man, who is fallen from the Dominion and Life of the God of Wiſdom, whoſe delight is to dwell in his People, and reveal in them his ſecrets, and make known unto them (by that which ſearcheth the Heart) the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches of the Myſteries of his Will, inſtructing them, as a tender Father, in the Perfect Way of Life, that unto them who feel his Power, an Eternal Inheritance he may give, and at laſt receive them in the Arms of his Love, with him to reign in the Light of endleſs Glory forever.</p>

            <p>Now, therefore awake ye all to Righteouſneſs, ſtand in awe and ſin not, commune with your own Hearts, and be ſtill, and in the cool of the day, and quietneſs of your Mind, liſten ye then to the voice of the Word in your Hearts, and prize and tender that which moveth in you againſt that which is Evil, and come to be guided by that in you which is Light, which cometh from him who is the God of Love, whoſe love is already ſhed abroad in the Hearts of many, which conſtraineth them to wait in his Light to receive his Power and further Diſcoveries of his Will, who willeth that all men ſhould be ſaved from Eternal Death and Damnation, and not dye under the horrible Terrors of his Fierce Wrath, nor periſh in the Darkneſs of Unbelief, and Rebellion againſt that Power which made man at firſt Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and now from a fatherly pity doth call after all Mankind, that they may return from Evil, and come unto him, and be ſaved from Wrath to come, and find plenteous Redemption in the Life of his Power, and be gathered into the Comlineſs of his Love, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of his Immortality,

            <p>For behold, the Day-ſtar of the Morning is riſen, and his Glitterings are enlightning the Dark parts of the World, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations is it ariſing, to declare in the Hearts of many, the ſpringing forth of the day of Judgment upon the vail and night of Darkneſs, which hath long covered that from man, by which all Mankind might come to ſee the Fountain of endleſs Love, which now through Judgment, by the brightneſs of the Light is brought near unto all People whoſe Hearts are open to receive it, and the Light of the Morning-Star (which ariſeth in the Hearts of the beloved choſen Seed) is bringing to Judgment the hidden things of Diſhoneſty, and in ſecret reproving the Double-mindedneſs of man, that <hi>Deceit, Defraud</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> out of him may be cleanſed, and the ground of all <hi>Vanity, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> and <hi>Luſt</hi> diſcovered and removed, that Death upon Death with Judgment through the Light may come, that by the <hi>Light Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> may come forth and ariſe in the ſtrength of immortal Power, breaking through that which ſeparated man from <hi>Unity, Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> that unto it all Nations may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubject, and by the force of its Lowlineſs be drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Hill of Holineſs,</hi> and reſt together in the <hi>heavenly Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> upon the Mount of Refuge forever.</p>
            <p>For the Son of Righteouſneſs is riſen with Healings in his Wings, and an overſhadowing Power is with him; and they that come to the Fruit of his Love, are filled with Peace to their Souls, and ſo come to that which may be received in the Heart, and which is given to heal all Nations, and ſpring up in the midſt of them as a Tree of Life, whoſe Fruit ſhall never fail World without End.</p>
            <p>And this glorious Light of Life, and Power of Love, is ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Darkneſs in the Hearts of Thouſands in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of the World, and is ſhining forth in the brightneſs of Righteouſneſs towards the utmoſt parts of the South, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Kindreds upon the Face of the Earth, reaching from the Eaſt to the Weſt, to declare and give the knowledge of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Power, which in the Hearts of the <hi>humble, harmleſs</hi> and <hi>ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded</hi> may be felt and received, if they rebel not againſt the

            <p>Now therefore all ye tall Cedars of the Earth, whoſe Heads are lifted up on high above others, and whoſe Minds are exalted above the Principle of Meekneſs in your ſelves, this are you all to know, even that Power of Eternal Life, which is to rule in and over you: And ſee that by greatneſs of your Honour and and Glory in this preſent World, your Hearts be not thereby lifted up in Pride, Ambition and Wrath, ſo as thereby to keep your ſelves from the attaining unto a Pearl of far more &amp; greater Price, and of a more durable Subſtance; for great is the Riches, Honour and Dignity that is coming near unto you, if you let not your Hearts be hardened againſt it, in the ſtrength and perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your own Wills, deſpiſing the Day of your Viſitation of Love, and rejecting the Meſſage of Life to your Souls, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning that by which you might come to live forever, and have Dominion over Death and Hell, and eſcape the Torment which all them fall into in the day of their Death, who dye out of the Covenant of Life and Peace; the which Covenant that you may attain unto, and come to live in forever; let <hi>Love</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercy</hi> be received in you, and then brought forth by you, and let <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> be placed in your Hearts with it, in tenderneſs to rule over others; and let the <hi>Light</hi> in you (which lets you ſee the thing that is Evil) lead and guide you to ſpeak and do the thing that is good, right and juſt; and let your Words be few, ſound, ſober and meek, and hate not them, who from good will to your Souls bring the Reproof of Life unto you, or publiſh the word of Repentance among you, or proclaim this meſſage of Love and Peace within your Borders; let not ſuch be harmed, for a day and time of Viſitation is coming near upon you all, and happy may you be if you receive Inſtruction, and love the Light.</p>

            <p>Therefore of theſe things be ye all warned; for this do I know, that in many tender Babes and young Children, there is a meek, innocent, harmleſs Principle from God, who willeth not the Death of any; and they have a Light from Chriſt, that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, which Light is in them: And he ſaid, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, &amp; forbid them not; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God,</hi> who come unto him that is meek and low in Heart; therefore you ſhould ſuffer them to keep unto, &amp; come unto that which is meek and low in the Heart; <hi>for that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them:</hi> And Chriſt the Light had a love to little Children, and ſaid, <hi>He that will enter the Kingdom of God, must become as a little Child:</hi> Therefore Wo be to you, if you teach and cauſe ſuch to become the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, by following your deviſed Fables, evil Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and wrong Guidance in your own rebellious Wills: For behold, and look upon young Children, and ſee how innocent and lamb-like they look; and conſider if every thing were as good as God made it; and how much more, if they were brought forth in the Covenant of God? And wherein have they delight,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66375:90"/> in Pride or any Covetouſneſs, or any manner of Cruelty? And is it not better for their Souls, if you let them keep in that ſtate, and ſo to ſuffer them to come to Chriſt, who ſaveth from Sin, and his Power keepeth out of Sin, and his Light in the Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth for Sin, where it is, and he cometh to deſtroy the Works of the Devil? Therefore you ſhould conſider, that you are far from Chriſt, if you teach ſuch the works of the Devil, that never knew it, and teach Children to enter into Sin, which ſeparateth them and you from God, and keep you forever from Salvation, unleſs you come through Judgment out of it again, which many come ſhort of, and moſt attain not unto; <hi>for few there be that enter in at the strait Gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that you may the more conſider my words, and come into Moderation and the Wiſdom of God, in theſe and other things, to walk exemplary before your Children, and to be to them Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Gravity, Meekneſs and Sobriety; therefore ſhall I ſet before your Eyes ſome plain and ſimple Truths of my experience when I was a Child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> as concerning <hi>Tenderneſs,</hi> my Heart was much affected therewith, and Tears was as my meat and drink night and day; and often was my Heart refreſhed with love from God, when I came unto that which came from Chriſt, the Man of Sorrows, who ſaid, <hi>Come unto me; and ſuffer little Children to come unto me;</hi> but many deſpiſed my Tears, and vilified my Mournful ſtate, not knowing (as they ſaid) what the matter was with me; and much provocation was uſed to get me out of that Condition, and as I grew up, to hurry me into the Earth, which brought much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance upon my fooliſh deſpiſed ſtate, that fear and terror then entred upon me, and ghaſtly Dreams in the Night, and ſometimes ſtrange Viſions, in which I ſhould cry out, and ſpeak aloud, to the raiſing of all in the Houſe, who with all the means they uſed could not get me out of it, which even aſtoniſhed the Parents with fear, which things I well remember; and by the violent, fierce, wrathful Nature that ruled in others, was my quietneſs diſturbed, which begat Wrath and Anger in me again towards them, which may be a Warning to you; yet ſomething of God in me was not wholly overcome: And the firſt words, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture, that pierced my Heart, and remained with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66375:91"/> me, was, <hi>He hath filled the Hungry with good things, and the Rich hath he ſent empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The which words remained as a thing printed and ſealed in my Heart, from the pure love of God, and my Meditations of him and his Love was exceeding prevailent upon my little tender Heart, being a Child, and ſo much the greater was my Grief, when by the Earthly mindedneſs, and wrathful haſty Nature in Parents, and others, I was even forced out of it, and ſo provoked to Wrath, Grief and Diſcontent, and not ſuffered to come nor keep to Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>I am the Light,</hi> which I felt meek and low in the Heart, therefore was my Trouble great many times, and wrath and haſtineſs began to have entrance in me, the which being ſenſible of, and finding a love towards God to be much more precious than any thing of the World, and having a Hope towards him, I do affirm, That when I was a little Child, I ſhould and did often pray to God (believing there was a God, though I knew him not) even earneſtly did I pray with Tears, and my Heart was opened with his Love, to whom alſo I ſhould make my Complaint in ſecret ſometimes upon my Knees, when I could get into ſuch a place that none could ſee me, nor at all come to know it: And ſometimes as I went along the way, when it come into my heart, then ſhould I even as it were beg and cry with many Tears, and had boldneſs towards God, as towards a familiar Friend, though much in ſubmiſſion and fear, as one unworthy, becauſe I had ſinned againſt him: And for theſe things I had no Creature to be my Example, nor to learn it of, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor hearing of any that did the like, I durſt not let any know of it, nor wherefore I did ſo often weep, when they did ſee me; for I ſaw none but deſpiſed that condition, and were unſenſible of my ſtate.</p>
            <p>And ſo having not any that was ſenſible of that tender Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in me, to cheriſh that, or be a help to me in it; but all, (as I grew up) to nurſe up the evil earthly thing that was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in me (as I ſaid before) by that nature my Leaders were in; and as I grew in years, ſo that was apt to grow in me, my natural Father being more eager than moſt men, in labouring and caring for earthly things, that when I grew to the age of ſix or ſeven years, and upwards, there was ſeldem one day in ſix but he cauſed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66375:91"/> me to cry bitterly, and through provocation continually thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the Earth and Darkneſs got entrance in me more than before, and the tender Principle of God in me was vailed from me, and ſo became in after years as <hi>a Child of Wrath,</hi> diſobedient to God, as I have written in a Book entituled, <hi>Man driven out into the Earth,</hi> wherein is declared the dreadful Indignation of God that after came upon me (becauſe of that wicked Nature which I was led into) before I came into this peace with God, which now I do enjoy with him forever, whoſe Name my Soul doth magnifie for evermore.</p>
            <p>And this I do write to be an Enſample unto you, and a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you may not bring your Children into the like Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Torment and Condemnation as I was, and the more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, becauſe that few afterwards do return to God with all their Hearts, and enter in at the ſtraight Gate. And this you may alſo conſider, that this I write in plainneſs, and true love to you and your <hi>Children,</hi> for the good of Body and Soul that in the fear of the living God, you may train them up, ſo may you have comfort in them at the laſt, and they may grow up in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, to rule over ſuch outward Earthly things, as the Lord or you may commit into their hands; for this you may or ſhould know, that ſuch as truly fear God will do no Evil, nor waſte the Creatures upon their Luſt; and if you teach them to waſte the Creatures of God in <hi>Pride, luſt, vanity,</hi> and <hi>needleſs things when they are young,</hi> how can you expect, but they will abuſe, ſpend and waſte your Eſtate when they are grown up; and ſome have been bred up ſo high in Pride, that when they have wanted to maintain that, and other Wickedneſs, they have robb'd and ſtole to maintain it, and at laſt, with ſhame, come to untimely ends; and many things might be named which with the Light you may alſo ſee and know, that theſe things are of great concernment both for Body and Soul, and for your good and your <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore that it may go well with them and you, and that God may do them good at the latter end, let all your Children every where be trained up <hi>in the Way that they ſhould go, which Way is Chriſt,</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>I am am the Light,</hi> and the Light in them will let them ſee, that they ſhould not Lye, nor ſpeak Wicked Words, nor do any Violence one to another; and ſo
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66375:92"/> you are to train up your Children in the <hi>Light;</hi> for the Light is the Way in which they may come to know God, and hear his Voice; for God ſpeaks by him that is the Light: And God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Samuel,</hi> being yet a Child, and <hi>Ely</hi> bid the Child anſwer the Call of the Lord. And the Child, who anſwered the Call of the Lord, reproved old <hi>Ely</hi> the Prieſt; for that Prieſt's Sons were Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and knew not God; and them ſons of his were the firſt Prieſts that ever took Tythes by force, and they and their Father came to an untimely Death, under the Judgments of God, which is alſo to follow upon all them Prieſts that take Tythes by force. And certainly, when I was a Child the Light of Chriſt in me did let me ſee the Abominations of the Prieſts practices, and did ſpeak againſt their way of ſprinkling Infants, and ſaid, <hi>I ſhould never ſtand as a God-father for any</hi> (nor never did) whereat a man Swore at me, and ſaid, <hi>It was pity any one did it for me;</hi> but I ſaid, <hi>I mattered not if they had never done it; for I was never the better,</hi> though I had never heard any one ſpeak againſt the things, nor did not until many years after: And ſo, that which is now my Guide, is the ſame which was in the beginning before the Sin, and no other Foundation I never knew, neither can ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundation be laid in any, than that which is already laid, which is Chriſt within the hope of Glory; and he ſaith, <hi>I am the Light, come unto me; and ſuffer little Children to come unto me; for the Kingdom of God is of ſuch,</hi> as come to him meek and low in Heart, who ſaveth from Sin: And certainly I never knew the Kingdom of Righteouſneſs and Peace, until I became again as I was when I was a little Child: And how hard it is to come again into that ſimple innocent ſtate, (when degenerated from it) let Gods Witneſs in the Couſcience anſwer. Therefore is this written that you may not ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven from your Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take heed how you cauſe or ſuffer your Children to Babble many vain words with their Tongues, with a delight to hear them prattle when there is no need; for thereby afterward the Tongue becomes an unruly Member, <hi>ſet on fire of Hell,</hi> Jam. 3. 6. as I found and bore the fierce Indignation of the Lord for; and many little Children would not come to ſpeak ſo many vain and evil words, which <hi>corrupt the good Manners,</hi> if they were not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66375:92"/> much provoked thereunto; and ſeeing People delight to hear them ſpeak the moſt craſty words, which are from the ſubtilty of the Serpent; and many ſend their Children abroad among other wild People or Perſons, to have them learn ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and craſt, to ſpeak their words from, and how to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or too hard for others by ſubtil Words and Lyes alſo, in buying and ſelling, and when they have learned it, ſay, <hi>They can live any where,</hi> and that they can <hi>ſhift for themſelves, and live by their Wits and forecaſt,</hi> which indeed oft-times to deceive others; and yet there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuch a plain, honeſt, ſimple Principle in ſome, that they can never be brought into ſuch ſubtil words, nor into ſo many words as others, though they themſelves have much endeavoured to attain it, but they have been more plain and ſimple, <hi>and the Lord preſerveth the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 11. 6. and ſuch ſometimes could not defend their own cauſe, but were pleaded down when their cauſe was juſt, by others that had learned more of the Serpents ſubtilty, which the Vengeance of God will one day come upon, when the Lord avengeth the cauſe of the oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>And in this I have had alſo much experience; for when I was a Child I ſaw much into the vanity of needleſs words, and was very backward a long time in ſpeaking, and in that, and ſome other things, much differing from other Children, and many thought I would have been a fool, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>the fooliſhneſs of God,</hi> and therefore oft-times much means was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to cauſe me to ſpeak, and many Provocations long together, and yet not at all ſcarce make me ſpeak one word, for I ſaw then it was needleſs, and could not ask one <hi>how he did,</hi> when I ſaw he was well, nor anſwer that which was needleſs; and when I was a little grown up, and ſent upon any ſmall Errand, I ſhould deliver my Meſſage in very few words, that people thought I would be never like a man; and about ten years of Age my Father, in the fleſh, would ſometimes ſend me to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and it was long before he, and all others, could make me ask any more then the price he did allow me to ſell at; or if he did not ſet me a certain price, then I ſhould reſolve of a price in the mind, according as I ſaw the Market, and ſo I often ſold with the cheapeſt, being loth to take too much, and therefore was often eſteemed and called a <hi>Fool,</hi> and <hi>Dunce;</hi> but it had been eaſier for me, if I had never been drawn out of that ſtate, <hi>when I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66375:93"/> was taught of God, to do unto others, as I would be done unto,</hi> and was fearful to ſtrike any one, but rather gave way to them that ſtruck me, and ſo was by many of my equals abuſed, and it was hard for me to take away the life of any Creature, and pleaded much againſt it with my Father and Mother, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to do it, though it was but to kill a young Dog or Cat, or the like, my Life in me was grieved to do it, and much was I forced to <hi>harden my Heart</hi> before I could do any ſuch thing, though commanded by my Parents, which may be a warning to all Parents, that they be not the cauſe of <hi>the hardning of their Childrens hearts,</hi> and then ſay of them, they are hardy Lads, for that which <hi>har dens the heart</hi> ſeperates from God, who is <hi>Love,</hi> and from Chriſt, who comes to ſave the Life, and ſo <hi>the Sacrifice of God</hi> is not known, which is <hi>in the broken Heart,</hi> but the Lord is with the humble and the broken hearted: And you ſhould all take heed of provoking your Children to many words; for <hi>all fleſh ſhould be ſilent before the Lord,</hi> and their words and yours ſhould be <hi>few, ſeaſoned with ſalt,</hi> that they might miniſter grace to the Hearers; for God ſitteth in Heaven, unto whom an account muſt be given <hi>for every Idle word;</hi> and according to every word that a man ſhall ſpeak, ſhall he be judged. Therefore let the fear and dread of the Lord God be before your Eyes, that you bring not your Children into the <hi>Condemnation,</hi> by ſpeaking more then <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> Of plain ſimple Truth in few Words, left the Lord God of Heaven and Earth requite it of you, in the day of his firce Wrath, when you will not be able to <hi>anſwer him one of a Thouſand,</hi> and left you bring your tender ſimple Babes, to be Children of the Devil, and then it be not in your power to bring them back out of that ſtate again, but they dye in their ſins, upon whom the Wrath of God abideth.</p>
            <p>Therefore as you love and tender their good, both of Soul and Body, ſee that you keep, and in all things bring them to Gods Witneſs in them, and that will judg and reprove them for any Evil they have done, and will keep them more out of all Evil, then you by any other Reproof can do, and will anſwer your chaſtizing for any Evil to be juſt, when done in the true Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not exceeding the Offence committed, nor proceeding from the leaſt motion of the <hi>wrathful nature</hi> in you [mark that.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> take heed of provoking your Children to unquietneſs,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66375:93"/> neither diſturbe them of being quiet; for many are not content to ſee them ſober and quiet, but are provoking them to Lightneſs and vain Pleaſure, when they would be ſober, like <hi>Lambs;</hi> for it is written, <hi>In quietneſs and rest ſhall ye be ſaved,</hi> Iſa. 30. 13. <hi>And ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> I Theſ. 4. 11. <hi>And commune with your own Hears, and be ſtill,</hi> Pſal. 4. 4. For when I was a Child, I did often ſit and ſtand quiet long together, pondering many things in my Mind, and as I grew up all along <hi>that thing</hi> remained with me, that for an hour, or ſome hours, if I were not diſturbed, I ſhould ſit quiet, either waiting on the Lord for Counſel, or ſearching which motion in me to be guided by; And when I have been riding along the way, when I have ſound the right thing in me did not lead me, I have turned back and not rode that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: And my ſilent ſiting like a Fool, my Father hath often called <hi>ſtudying,</hi> and hath often ſharply reproved me for it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by way of Reproach, <hi>I would ſure ſtudy to be ſome great Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or another;</hi> and my Mother hath come to me, its like hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of times, both when I was a Child, and a Man, and in her pity hath laid hards on me, and bid me <hi>ſhould not ſit ſtudying ſo, for ſurely I would make my ſelf a fool,</hi> not knowing what my condition was: And being ſo uſually diſturbed and grieved, ſometimes on <hi>Firſt-dayes,</hi> or when I could, I ſhould get into ſome Wood, or place ſo private, that none ſhould find me, and there wait in quietneſs three or four hours, and ſometimes the Love of God would break through me, and his <hi>Word</hi> would make my <hi>heart ſoft,</hi> and I felt the ſame then which now is my Life; and now I know, that thoſe that <hi>wait on the Lord renew their ſtrength;</hi> and though it is written, <hi>The Lord was weary of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Sacrifices, and with their Words,</hi> Mal. 2. 17. Yet it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver written in Scripture, that the Lord was weary of thoſe that <hi>waited</hi> upon him. Therefore you ſhould ſuffer your Children to wait upon God (or at leaſtwiſe to be quiet) and <hi>that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them,</hi> Rom. 1. 19. And the Lord hath not leſt himſelf without a Witneſs in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and it is <hi>Chriſt that is given for a Witneſs,</hi> Iſa. 55. 4. and his Light ſhineth in their hearts, who ſaith, <hi>Come to me, and learn of me;</hi> for he is the Shepherd and Biſhop of the Soul, who teacheth all to Proſit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 17. <hi>And is that true Prophet, which whoſo hears not, the Soul is cut off;</hi> and certainly my Soul was cut
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66375:94"/> off from the Life, when I was forced from hearing his voice in me, that is <hi>a man of Sorrows, and as a Lamb dumb.</hi> Therefore take heed of provoking your Children to hear ken to a ſtranger, or another Teacher than he that is a <hi>living Mimſter within the vail, and the vail is over the Heart,</hi> where I have found that <hi>Inſtructor that ſhall never be removed,</hi> but all Teachers without may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and Prieſts and men may dye, <hi>but this abides a Prieſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being made by the Power of an endleſs Life,</hi> Heb. 7.</p>
            <p>And ſo now all ſuch as come to know ſomething of God in them, they alſo come to ſit in ſilence, and quietneſs, to receive Inſtructions from God, which is no new thing invented by the will of man, or learned one from another, but is the ſame with that which guided the Prophets, and was in my heart from God of a Child: and I do affirm in the preſence of the Lord God, <hi>that I had never returned out of that degenerate ſtate</hi> which I was hurried into, from the meaſure of the breath of Life in me, <hi>if I had not waited in, and been obedient unto the Light of Chriſt, which was in me ſo a Child:</hi> And you may all mind, that all along there hath been ſomething in you, which in ſecret did reprove you for ſin, and will let you ſee the ſins of your Youth or Childhood, and that is the Light of Chriſt, the Son of God, <hi>who ſo loved the World, that he gave his Son a Light into the World; and the World is ſct in the Heart,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 11. that all men through him might believe, and be ſaved from Wrath to come; and that is it that is given for a Witneſs, and the Witneſs is alſs in the Conſcience of a Child, which will teſtifie againſt it, after it hath done Evil, and the Countenance will fall, like <hi>Cain;</hi> but before they have done Evil they are not aſhamed, as <hi>Adam,</hi> being innocent; and if they be falſly accuſed of an Evil they have not done, they will have Boldneſs therein, and the Witneſs in them will juſtifie them; and the Witneſs is given, of God to be a Leader, Iſa. 54. 4. and a <hi>Captain,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. And <hi>the Lord in the midſt is mighty to ſave,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 9. And this is freely given to every one, without Money, and without Price, ſo that there is neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Greek, Barbarian</hi> nor <hi>Scythian,</hi> Bond nor Free, but Chriſt is all, and in all, and he is called <hi>a Witneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Light of the Gentiles;</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>I am the Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Light; And God is Light, who is above all, and through all,

And <hi>he hath placed a ſufficient meaſure in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one,</hi> Pſal. 46. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11. which was my Teacher when I knew no other, and before I knew what it was, and is my Teacher now, and is the ſame as ever it was, and <hi>doth not Change;</hi> and this is that which comes from God, and is not put in them by Man nor humane Learning, but men by their Eloqent Speeches and vain Deceit may lead them forth from that <hi>in them,</hi> and ſo break the Command of Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>Go not forth,</hi> Mat. 24. 25. And then when they are led forth after <hi>Lo here</hi> and <hi>Lo there,</hi> from the <hi>Rock,</hi> which Chriſt, the <hi>Light</hi> within, and from the ſure <hi>Foundation,</hi> which God hath laid, and no man can lay another, though they deſpiſe this, and reject, and refuſe this precious Corner-ſtone, which is the Light that ſhineth in the heart to give the knowledge of God, from the which being led by the ſubtility of mans fallen Wiſdom, then are they liable to follow any deviſed Fables, and Imaginations, and Sects, and Opinons, and to be ſcattered upon every dry, barran and dark Mountain, as the Lord knoweth I was long, not knowing where to find Reſt, having been hurried from, and led out from my true Guide, from and by the which at firſt I could pray with the Spirit, as in meaſure the Spirit that was within helped my Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, with Sighs and Tears, which being led out from, and the tender Motions of it quenched, then after I grew up, was taught to ſay Prayers, and ſome Prayers that others learned out of Books, and this they laid upon me to ſay every night, but I found that was juſt <hi>as dry Heath, inſtead of a Honey-comb before.</hi>

               <p>THe Lord God formed man of the Duſt of the Ground, and breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and and man became a living Soul. So man was formed of that which was earthly, and into that which was earthly, that which was living was breathed; and that which is living comes from God, which is to keep and lead man unto God; but man going from that which is living, into that which is Earthly, is thereby led from God, and being led from that which is living, he is alſo pleading for another thing than that which is the Life, to be his Rule and Guide, and ſo comes not to be guided by that which is manifeſt of God in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. Now the Letter is not living, but the Breath of <hi>Life</hi> within is; the which living Breath man not knowing, goeth forth from it to be guided by the Letter which killeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>But the holy men of God, who walked with God, and were obedient to his Will, and ſpake forth and writ Scriptures from that which was holy in them, and were Perfect in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they were ſuch who came to be guided by that which was living in them, and from that men in dayes of old called upon the Name of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 28. and they had not a Scripture without them to guide them thereunto.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and ſo he walked with that which is living, and not with that which is earthly, neither had he a Scripture (without him) to be his Rule; and ſo he walking with him who is the <hi>Life,</hi> came to be tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5.</p>

               <p>And the Lord, who is the one Spirit, was <hi>Abraham's</hi> Leader from his Kindred, and Father's Houſe; and ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> heard that which was living, and obeyed that which was ſpiritual, who had not a Scripture to be his Rule; and unto him the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and bleſſed, and in the time of the grievous Famines he and his ſeed was fed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10. And he that is led by the Spirit comes, thereby to receive feedings when the Famine comes upon them who are led by another thing; and <hi>Abraham,</hi> who followed the Lord, was called the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> and he (through believing) became the Father of many Nations; and he ſaw the day of Chriſt, the Light, and obeyed the Word, which liveth and abideth forever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. and being led by that which is living from his Father's Houſe, and out of his Country, ſo by that which is living was he preſerved, and him God loved, and to him afterward the Word of the Lord did come, ſaying, <hi>Fear not</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy Shield, and thy exceeding great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwered the Lord, and the ſeed which God bleſſed came forth of his Loins, who are led by the Spirit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9.</p>

And the beginning of this mighty Hunter's Kingdom was <hi>Babel,</hi> where the Lord (whom he hunted before) followed after, and confounded the Language of all them that belonged to this mighty Hunter, who was a mighty one in the Earth; and out of this Land of <hi>Babel</hi> went forth them that built many Cities, and afterwards there was a People whoſe gods were according to the number of their Cities: And ſo, ſee what followeth when man is not led by the Spirit of God (as <hi>Noah</hi> was, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) but hunts mightily before him, being mighty in that which is Earthly; firſt he is mighty in the Earth, then a mighty Hunter, then builds a mighty Tower, whereby he that is earthly would climb up to Heaven [this a Figure] and then God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Language; and after wards thoſe that were in the many Languages profeſſed God (who confounded the Language) before whom their Father <hi>Nimrod</hi> hunted; and they being found in that which God confounded, though they profeſſed God, yet in Works denyed him, and crucified his Son, the Lord of Glory, and writ over his Head, of the many Languages, <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and this was written above him that was the Light; and ſo them now who are of the ſtock of <hi>Babel,</hi> are yet exalted above the Light, and count the Light a weak and low contemptible thing, not able to ſave it ſelf, much leſs to ſave them that believe in it; and ſo therein manifeſt themſelves to be of their Fathers, who crucified him that ſaid, <hi>I am the Light,</hi> and ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, ſave thy ſelf;</hi> and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed him who came to ſave them. And this is ſome of the effect of mans hurting mightily in the Earth (before they came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit) as <hi>Nimrod</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 18, 25. ch 10. 8, 9, 10, 11. ch. 11. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>John</hi> 19. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Jacob</hi> followed, obeyed and believed the Lord, who is a Spirit, and the Preſence of God was with him, and the Bleſſing of the Moſt High was upon him; and the Lord promiſed, <hi>To be with him</hi> (who was a Worm) <hi>in ſix Troubles, and in ſeven; and when he paſſed through the Fire and the Water;</hi> and God gave him a new Name, and afterwards promiſed, To give his Seed a Name
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66375:100"/> better than of Sons and Daughters; and <hi>Jacob</hi> was a plain man, and dwelt in Tents, and him God loved, and he prevailed with God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 14. ch. 43. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 5.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Nimrod</hi> (with his Followers) who was mighty in the Earth, came to be confounded, and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was (little in the Earth) as a Worm, and dwelt in Tents, he and his Seed came to be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Servant of the Lord, whom God Almighty honoured in his everlaſting Love, and made him a Deliverer unto, and a Judge and Ruler over the People, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 35. he being in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Land of Darkneſs and Bondage, and all the Seed and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God in cruel Oppreſſion; and I do not read that he had any direction from Man or Scripture, or any thing elſe without him, to guide him at firſt to refuſe to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Daughter, and the glory of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to chuſe to ſuffer Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the People of God: Neither do I read, that he ſaw the Angel or Glory of the Lord, until after he was, and had been Obedient unto that which God had given into him (<hi>for that which may be known of God, is manifeſt within,</hi> Rom. 1. 19.) for it is ſaid in the Scriptures of Truth, <hi>That it was by Faith</hi> (Heb. 11. 24.) <hi>that he refuſed the evil, and choſe the good;</hi> and Faith is that which is in the Heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. As it is written, <hi>If thou believe in thy Heart,</hi> Rom. 10. 9. Acts 18. 37. <hi>And of that Faith in the Heart, God hath given to every man a Proportion,</hi> Rom. 12. 6. And as that (which is but little) in man is loved and obeyed, ſo man comes to know more of God, and hear his Word of Faith, which is in the Heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. And by hearing and Obedience of Faith man receiveth the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. which is an undeniable Truth, which I might prove by a cloud of Witneſſes from the Scriptures, which were given forth from the Inſpiration of God, by his holy Servants: And ſo there being ſomething of God in man, whereby man may (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did) firſt refuſe the Evil, and then chuſe a ſuffering ſtate, and ſo learn to do well, the Sin then comes to be done away, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 17, 18. and afterwards more of God's enleſs Love and powerful Preſence is made manifeſt; and ſo being faithful in the little received from God in the Heart, man comes to rule over much, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, who firſt learned the Obedience of Faith in the Heart, though in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66375:101"/> time of great Perſecution, where he was alſo deſpiſed of his Brethren, yet he obeyed the Word of Faith in the Heart, and ſo afterwards to him God appeared, and the Word of the Lord came unto him, and he talked with God afterwards face to face, as a man talketh with his Friend; and the many Wonders that the mighty Power of God wrought in and by him, are recorded at large in the holy Scriptures for a Teſtimony thereof, to laſt throughout many Generations. And by this Faith alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Members of Chriſt did walk, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Moſes,</hi> was full of the Spirit of Wiſdom; [conſider that] he was firſt full of the Spirit, and ſo thereby he came to be a Leader and Ruler over others, and the Dread of the Lord fell, and his Judgments came upon them who roſe up, or ſtood againſt him, and thoſe whom he by the Power of the Spirit in him came to rule over; and great, many and mighty were the Victories that God gave unto this man, who was bold and couragious by reaſon of the fullneſs of the Spirit that was in him; and the People hearkned unto him, as they did unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he left nothing undone of all that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 34. 9. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
               <p>But the Lords people in theſe dayes, who are led by the Spirit of God in them, are accounted both by Prieſts, Rulers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be drunk or mad, as it was before, when the Son of God (who is the Light) was revealed in <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. he was accounted by the Ruler of the People to be mad, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 24. And when the Diſciples of Chriſt had waited, and afterwards received the Spirit of Truth within, from the which they ſpake, as with new Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance; at them then many were amazed, others mocked, ſuppoſing them to be drunk, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14, 15. And when <hi>Hunnah</hi> prayed in Heart, being grieved in Spirit, was eſteemed to be drunk, even by <hi>Ely</hi> the Prieſt, yet ſhe by her Prayers in her Heart, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her deſire of the Lord, who gave her a Son that knew the Lord, and miniſtered before him, being yet a Child; but the Sons of <hi>Ely</hi> the Prieſt, were Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and knew not God, (like the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi>) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. and 2. 18.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own Heart, was a deaf man, and heard not, and as a dumb man that openeth not his Mouth,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66375:101"/> being dumb with Silence, and held his Peace even from good until his Heart was hot within him, and the Fire burned, then he ſpake with his Tongue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 9. and afterwards he ſaid, <hi>Thy Word have I hid in my Heart,</hi> (which Word is as a Fire) <hi>that I might not ſin againſt thee;</hi> and ſo that which keepeth from Sin is hid in the Heart; and that Word <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>was a Lamp to his Feet, and a Light unto his Paths;</hi> which Word he kept, and loved the <hi>Law of the Lord,</hi> which is written in the Heart, and ſo was made wiſer than his Enemies, and had more underſtanding than the Ancients, and all his Teachers, <hi>Pſal..</hi> 119. 10, 11. verſ. 42, 43, 50, 67, 81, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105.</p>
               <p>And all the Prophets of the Lord were led, guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them, both in their Actions, which ſometimes were as Fooliſhneſs and Madneſs in the Eyes of the Profeſſing <hi>Jews,</hi> and alſo in their Words, which ſometimes were as Thunder againſt the ungodly, though they were the Rulers of the People; and their Words were ſo Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible againſt them that profeſſed Godlineſs, and lived in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that <hi>Amaziah</hi> the high Prieſt ſaid of one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, (who ſpake in the dread of the Lord) <hi>That the whole Land was not able to bear his Words, Amos</hi> 7. 10.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Bethuel,</hi> being not able to bear the Word of the Lord, therefore he falſly accuſed <hi>Amos</hi> of conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the King, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. And from the Spirit in them did the Prophets with boldneſs declare againſt the Wickedneſs of the Rulers of the People, ſaying to the poluted City, <hi>Thy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are Rebellious, and Companions of Thieves; they love Gifts and Rewards, and judge not the Fatherleſs, nor the cauſe of the Widdow; and ſuh as theſe are the Adverſaries and Enemies of the Lord, upon whom he will be avenged, and all them that trouble his Servants, Iſa.</hi> 1. 23, 24. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 6. And it is juſt and right for the Friends of Chriſt to declare againſt the Enemies of the Lord, and thoſe that decree unrighteous Decrees, and write grievouſneſs which they have preſcribed, and turn aſide the Needy from Judgment, and take away the Right of the People, that they may Rob the Fatherleſs; againſt theſe is the Hand of the Lord ſtretched out, and they are to bow down under the Priſoners,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66375:102"/> and fall under the ſlain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. and ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Wo to the filthy and poluted City, her Princes are roaring Lyons, her Judges are evening Wolves, her Prophets are light and treacherous, her Prieſts have poluted the Sanctuary, Zeph.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ſuch expreſſions they uſed, which was not Railing, but ſound Words in the fear and dread of the Lord; read <hi>Amos</hi> the firſt and ſecond Chapters.</p>
               <p>And from the Spirit of Truth in them did they alſo declare, even againſt ſuch as were the Teachers and Leaders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and were made Miniſters by a Law of God, which Law was then in force, and thoſe Miniſters departing out of the way, and corrupting the Covenant, (like the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord made them (as he will theſe, who deny the Way, the Light) baſe and contemptible in the Eyes of all the People, becauſe they alſo have been partial in the Law, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8, 9. and againſt ſuch did (and do) the Servants of the Lord declare, they being ſuch Shepherds that cannot underſtand, but are blind, ignorant, dumb, greedy Dogs, (theſe are the worſt of Dogs) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10, 11. and by ſuch is the horrible thing committed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30, 31. <hi>And the Paſtors are become bruitiſh,</hi> Jer. 10. 21. <hi>Therefore hearken not unto them,</hi> Jer. 27. 13, 15, 16. verſes; alſo read <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. <hi>For as Troops of Robbers wait for a man, ſo the company of Prieſts murther in the way by conſent, Hoſ.</hi> 6. 9. And one of the chief of that number is <hi>John Hodder,</hi> Prieſt of the Pariſh called <hi>Haychurch,</hi> in the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and there was a People, the Heads thereof judged for Reward, and the Prieſts teached for Hire, and the Prophets divined for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, (is it not ſo in <hi>England?) Mich.</hi> 3. 11. and ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>O ye Prieſts, this Commandment is for you, I will ſend a Curſe upon you, and corrupt your Seed, and ſpread Dung upon your Faces, even the Dung of your ſolemn Feaſts,</hi> [hearken ye Prieſts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land] Mal.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. And this was and is ſound Doctrine, which the itching Ears of the falſe Teachers of our dayes cannot endure to hear, being found themſelves ſuch curſed Children that cannot ceaſe from Sin, that were to come in the latter dayes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. and thoſe Words, and many more to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, were they guided by the Spirit of Chriſt (the Light) in them to ſpeak; and from that Spirit they declared againſt the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66375:102"/> Rulers, Prieſts and People, who had the Law or Letter, and <hi>Moſes</hi> Writings without them, yet were Enemies to the Spirit of Truth within. But the Prophets ſearched diligently to ſee what, and what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt in them did ſignifie, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. So that the Spirit of Chriſt was in the Prophets, which teſtiſied unto them, and was their Rule and Guide.</p>
               <p>And when Chriſt came who is the end of the Prophets, and the Law, he alſo declared againſt the ſame generation, as the Prophets did (and we do) and he ſaid, <hi>They were of their Father the Devil,</hi> who did his Works, notwithſtanding they had the Scriptures and the Oracles of God, and were of the place of holy Worſhip, and were zealous and ſtrict therein, even againſt them did Chriſt proclaim many Woes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. for the Word of God had no place in them, neither could they hear it, <hi>John</hi> 8. 37, 43. but in Chriſt the Light did all the fullneſs of God dwell, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. &amp; 2. 9. And ſo, he that had the fullneſs of <hi>God</hi> within him, was counted a Deceiver, a Blaſphemer, denyed and crucified by them that had the Oracles of God without them, and read the Prophets every Sabbath-day (yet knew not their Voices, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 27.) which propheſied of him, whom they knew not when he was come (who is the Light.) And now we do bear witneſs, that the Light is come, as did <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. 1, 2, 3. though Darkneſs covers the Earth, and groſs Darkneſs the People, yet in him that is the Light, doth the fulneſs of God abide; <hi>and no man cometh to the Father</hi> (or fulneſs of God) <hi>but the Son,</hi> who is Light. And now, thoſe that have the Scripture (and call that their Rule) in the which they read of Chriſt the Light, yet the Light they deny, and ſo deny him of whom the Scriptures ſpeak, and him unto whom all Power in Heaven &amp; Earth is committed; and ſo long as they deny him, who is the Light, unto whom all Power is committed, they cannot receive Power from him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, but they who do receive and believe in him who is the Light, <hi>unto them he gives Power to become the Sons of God,</hi> John 1. 12.</p>
               <p>And now the zealous profeſſing Jews, Scribes and Phariſees have the Scriptures, but they deny him that is the <hi>Light,</hi> and ſo they are blind; and all thoſe muſt needs be blind who hate the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66375:103"/> 
                  <hi>Light,</hi> and deny it; and ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Oracles of God without them, and the Law without them, and Chriſt the Son of God without them, and among them, preaching to them, and yet they were deaf and blind, and of the Devil; for they did his Works.</p>
               <p>And moreover, the Diſciples of Chriſt might read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without them, and they had him, in whom was the fullneſs of God, among them, with them, or without them, and yet in many things they underſtood not, <hi>John</hi> 12. 16. but were often asking Queſtions, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 10, 36. chap. 16. 22. ch. 17. 10, 13, 19. ch. 18. 1, 21. ch. 19. 10. ch. 24. 3. <hi>John</hi> 13. 7. and ſome time they knew not what Spirit they were of, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 55. and though he had been a long time with them, yet it was hard for them to know him, <hi>John</hi> 14. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. and though he had been ſo long time with them; [conſider] (it was with them) (for [<hi>With</hi>] may be one thing, and [<hi>In</hi>] another) until he had finiſhed the Work (without them) which the Father gave him to do, <hi>John</hi> 17. 4. [Conſider] (the outward Work of Chriſt without, or among the Diſciples, may be finiſhed) and he was at the Paſſover with them, and at the Supper with them, and gave his Life for them; and they ſaw his Body broken, and his Blood ſhed without them; and yet not withſtanding all this, afterwards he (that is, the <hi>Light</hi>) upbraided them of Unbelief and Hardneſs of Heart, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 14. who for a long time had the fulneſs of God amongſt, and with them, who being with them, ſaid, <hi>He that is with you, ſhall be in you,</hi> John 14. 17. And ſo they were to wait to receive him [<hi>within</hi>] and that within was to abide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but that without departed away; but that within was and is to lead into all Truth, and be with his to the end of the World; for that which is in man, is alwayes with him; but that which is with man, and not in him, may not alwayes be with him. And now the Light is in man, and ſo he that is with his to the end of the World, is the Light of the World, who is the Reſurrection and the Life, who was dead, and is alive, and I ſay, he liveth for evermore, who hath finiſhed his Work in the outward things, to wit, <hi>Circumciſion, Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Supper,</hi> and <hi>Death on the Croſs</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gate, and is now revealed within, and worketh all our Works in us, and ever liveth to make Interceſſion for us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12.

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. in whoſe Hearts he is now crying, <hi>Abba</hi> Father, and he that hath the Son, hath alſo the Father, to whom be Eternal Dominion, Glory, Honour, and humble. Obedience for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>And ſo Chriſt Jeſus being alſo guided by that of God, or rather the fulneſs of God in him, whereby he finiſhed his Work, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted away from among them, and bid them wait for that which ſhould abide with them forever; and ſaid, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, being yet preſent with you, but the Comforter, whom the Eather will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things,</hi> John 14. 16, 25, 26. and that which teacheth all things was to be revealed within, and until that was come and revealed in them, they did not know all things; ſo that that which teacheth all things, and ſheweth plainly of the Father, and abideth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is to be received within; and they in Obedience to his Command did wait, and their waiting was not in vain; for when the time was fully come, they did receive the Promiſe of the Father, which they had waited for, and ſo were filled with the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. as <hi>Joſhua</hi> was full of the Spirit; and in Chriſt was the fullneſs of God; and <hi>Stephen</hi> was a man full of the holy Ghoſt; and the Deſires of ſuch was, <hi>That others might be filled with all the Fullneſs of God,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 19. (Its not filled with the Scriptures) And ſo they being filled with that which was holy, were by that led in the Way of Holineſs, and with that which was holy in them, were they to build up one another, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. and then they ſpoke the Word of God with Boldneſs: and after the Son of God was revealed in <hi>Paul,</hi> three years after he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſee <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years after he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by Revelation, <hi>Gal:</hi> 2. 1, 2. And ſo, he did not ſay, he went by the Scriptures, or any Command without him, but by <hi>Revelation,</hi> and a Revelation is within; and that all the Miniſters and Diſciples of Chriſt did come to be led and guided by his Spirit that was in them, might eaſily be proved by many undeniable Truths of plain Scripture, wereby it might more largely appear, that they were all led, guided and directed by the one Spirit in them, though the Gifts, Leadings and Operations of that one Spirit in them was various, as may be read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:66375:104"/>
               <p>And now, moſt People will grant this before written to be true, That all the People of God formerly were led by the Spirit that was in them; but that men ſhould now in theſe dayes be led by the Spirit of Chriſt in them, is by many denyed; the which thing chiefly is that which I would a little ſearch into, or rather open to thee, from that which hath ſearched me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23. and that according to the Scriptures of Truth, if that will be by thee regarded, that ſo it might appear unto all that are not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Rebellious againſt the Light of Chriſt in their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and alſo deniers of plain Scripture, by the which I am ready to prove, That the People of the Lord and Miniſters of Chriſt were not only led by the Spirit of God themſelves, but alſo in their Words and Writings did direct others thereunto, ſaying, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, be filled with the Spirit, and Worſhip God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Gal 5. 16. Epheſ. 5. 18. Phil. 3. 3. John 4. 24.</p>
               <p>But ſay the People, <hi>Though they did walk, and direct others to walk by the Spirit, yet are not we now to walk by the Scriptures? And is not the Scriptures now to be our Rule? And are we not to be led by that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>I Anſwer:</hi> That God changeth not; And where doth the Scriptures ſay, That the Scripture is to be a Rule to walk or be led by? And the Miniſters of Chriſt did not ſay, <hi>As every man hath received the Scriptures, ſo Walk;</hi> But <hi>As every man hath received Chriſt</hi> (and he is the Light) <hi>ſo walk,</hi> Col. 2. 6. Conſider, there is firſt ſomething to be received, and then there is to be a walking in the Power and Strength of that received; for a Babe is not able to walk by all the words that may be ſpoken unto him, until he receive power and ſtrength within him; <hi>and the new born Babes are to receive the ſincere Milk of the Word</hi> (and the Word is in the Heart) and then to grow up by that received, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. and every man is to walk as he hath received of Chriſt the Light, which comes from the Word, which lighteth every man, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. but every man doth not receive that into the good Underſtanding which he is lighted with, but rather ſtrives againſt, and hates it; for <hi>every one that doth Evil hateth</hi> (not the Scriptures, but) <hi>the Light,</hi> John 3. 20. and ſo they hate that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66375:104"/> in which the Power ſtandeth; but as many as receive him who is the Light, to them (and none but them) he that is the Light gives Power; and he hath gifts for the Rebellious, but they hating the Light, and his own, whom he lighteth, receive not him that is the Light, and to them he committeth no more, and ſo they have not Power (yet they may have the Scriptures.) And ſo man walks by the ſtrength that is in him, which ſtrength comes from the Word by which all things were made; and man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ingrafted Word (which is not the Scriptures) it is able to ſave the Soul; for Chriſt, the Light, whoſe Name is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Rev. 19. 13. is able to ſave to the utmoſt all them that come to God through the Light of the World, Chriſt Jeſus; and in him <hi>neither Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but a New Creature; and as many as walk according to this Rule,</hi> (I do not ſay my Writings) <hi>peace be unto them,</hi> Gal. 6. 15, 16. And ſo, here was the <hi>Rule,</hi> which whoſo walked by, the Peace belonged to; but many call the Scriptures their Rule, and have not Peace; but they to whom the Spirit is a Rule, from it to them Peace comes; and man being led by the Spirit in him, hath that to be his Rule from whence the Scripture was given forth. And now, that which man is to be directed, guided and led by, tryes, meaſures or ſearches things, that ſometimes he calls Rule; and it is not ſaid, the Scriptures ſearcheth all things, but the Scripture is to be ſearched into, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. and its ſaid, <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 10. Prov. 20. 27. and that Spirit which ſearcheth all things, comes from him <hi>Who hath meaſured the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand, and meeted out Heaven with a Span, and comprehended the Duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure, and weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance,</hi> Iſa. 40. 12. <hi>and draws a Line through the midſt of his People, and layeth Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Plummet, and ſweepeth away the Refuge of Lyes,</hi> Iſa. 28. 17. <hi>and telleth the number of the Stars, and calleth them all by their Names,</hi> Pſal. 147. 4.</p>
               <p>And they to whom this Spirit is a Rule, and are led by it, they are the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. and it is not ſaid, as many as are led by the Scriptures, are the Sons of God; and man is to walk by the ſame Rule of that he hath attained, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. and mark
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66375:105"/> them that walk ſo; and it is ſaid, <hi>If ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law,</hi> Gal. 5. 18. but many have the Scriptures, and yet are under the Law, but the Spirit, which is the Word, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. cometh (and hath power) to redeem from under the Law, which the Scriptures doth not; <hi>for through the Spirit the Deeds of the Fleſh come to be mortified,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. And while <hi>Paul</hi> profited much in that Religion which he learned from the Phariſees, he was an Enemy to Chriſt the Light; but when Chriſt was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, and he obedient to the heavenly Viſion, then was he led by the Spirit in him, to do God's Will; and he did not ſay, That the Myſtery of Chriſt, which in other Ages was not made known, was then manifeſt to him by the Scriptures; but he ſaid, That it was by <hi>Revelation</hi> made known unto him, and revealed to the holy Apoſtles and Prophets by the <hi>Spirit, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 4, 5. and he did not ſay, without Scriptures it was impoſſible to pleaſe God, but it is ſaid, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. and Faith is in the Heart, and purifies the Heart; and ſo without that in the Heart, (which purifies it) men cannot pleaſe God; and ſo man cannot pleaſe God without being guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that (in the heart) which reſpects no mans Perſon, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.

            <p>For behold, I ſay, your day is come, wherein you ſhall bow down under the Priſoners, and fall under the ſlain, according to the words of the Spirit of Prophecy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 4. and the ſlain over you ſhall rejoyce for evermore, having the high Praiſes of God in their Mouthes, and the Sword of the Spirit in their Hearts, with which they ſhall cut in pieces and pierce in ſunder the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of all fleſh, and it shall be as Chaff before them, and the ſtrength thereof as the paſſing away of the Morning-cloud, and in the ſtrength of the moſt high, shall the Army of the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> go on and proſper, even as <hi>Kings,</hi> whoſe Armies are ſwift to the Battel, their faces are as an Adamant, and their Countenances firce and terrible, the found of their Voice is dreadful, and the noiſe of their Appearance Aſtoniſh the <hi>Heathen;</hi> the Earth before them is full of its Fruit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them its a deſolate Wilderneſs, they ſpare not the Antient nor the Honourable, neither have they reſpect to the Perſons of men; they even ſmile at Deſtruction when its coming, and they are prepared for all your Oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>VVherefore now gather your ſelves together, O ye Potſherds of the Earth, and ſtand up, all you that thirſt for blood; aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves together, all ye Perſecutors, let your Counſels come up from Hell, and let the depth of the Powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs shew forth it ſelf in the utmoſt of its ſtrength, and with it combine ye all together, and ſtand up in the Power of your King, which is the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Bottomleſs Pit,</hi> who is head among (in) and over all you who thriſt for the blood of the Innocent.

            <p>And this I ſay plainly unto you, that your long Tyranny will never weary out the patience we have received, neither can you inflict more puniſhment than the Lord hath enabled us to bear; and as your Wrath is incraſed, our Humility is increaſed much more; and as you are filled and moved with Envy, we are much more filled and overcome with the Power of the Fathers Life, and though you contrive ways to enſnare the Innocent, we take no thought aforehand to deliver our ſelves; for <hi>Self</hi> we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, and we have given up our Bodies and Souls a living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God, to do or ſuffer his Will: And him that kills the Body we fear not, much leſs thoſe that can but Whip or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but for a few Moneths; for our Life you cannot reach, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can you diſturb their Reſt whom the Lord hath crowned with Honour, who out of the World are redeemed and bought with the price of Blood moſt precious, but are become his, to follow him whither-ever he leads them, though it be through Tryals, great Tribulations, Bonds and long Impriſonments; theſe things cannot move them who are brought to reſt in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farts, and ſleep in the Woods; yea, and there is none can make them afraid with all their Threats, unrighteous Laws, Bonds, Bridewels, long unjuſt Impriſonments, or Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And this Honour hath the Saints, and herein do they rejoyce for evermore, in that they are counted worthy to ſuffer for his Names ſake, who was made perfect through ſufferings, and and thereby overcame all the Powers of Darkneſs, whereby <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers are ſpoiled forever; and through ſufferings are we made more than Conquerers over all our Enemies,</hi> whoſe Day will have an end, whoſe Cruelty will ceaſe, whoſe Tyranny will be rewarded upon their own Heads, and their Memorial will Rot forever; but the faithfulneſs of the Faithful ſhall never be taken from him, nor the innocency of the Harmleſs ſhall never be forgotten, neither ſhall they ever want ſtrength to ſtand in the day of Battel, nor courage and boldneſs to endure, when the Enemies of the Lord ariſe in Oppoſition againſt the brightneſs of the riſing of the Power of the Lamb of God, who is come to

               <p>And therefore Chriſt, when he was upon Earth did often ſpeak unto them of what was yet to come, and I do ſeldom read or take notice, that he did ſo often preach and repeat any one thing unto them, as that of the Spirit to come, ſaying, <hi>That it</hi> (Mark, <hi>the Spirit) would lead into all Truth;</hi> and ſeeing their Weakneſs and Unbelief, (<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 14.) he by the often repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition thereof, did as it were the more chiefly engage their Hearts to wait for and ſeek after the incomes of that which ſhould comfort them, and abide with them, when his Body was gone from them, whither they could not come; and to this one thing doth he direct them in various expreſſions, as of his going to the Father, and coming again, and ſaith he, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive,</hi> John 12. 16. <hi>And many things Jeſus did, which if they ſhould be all written, the World might not contain the Books,</hi> John 21. 25. <hi>And many things he ſpake unto them,</hi> Acts 2. 40. and yet there was ſomething to come to be waited for, and after to be received, which was more than all this; for ſaid he, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, being yet preſent with you; But the Comforter (Mark)</hi> the word [BUT] intimateth ſomething greater, or more than what was ſpoken to them, whilſt he was with them; for he ſaith, <hi>He that is with you ſhall be in you,</hi> John 14. 17. and ſaid, <hi>But the Comforter, which is the holy Spirit, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he will teach you all things,</hi> (Mark what that is that teacheth all things) <hi>and bringeth all things to your Remembrance what ſoever I have ſaid</hi> (and ſo that is within which bringeth the words of Spirit and Life to remembrance) <hi>John</hi> 14. 25, 26. And having ſpoken of other things, he ſaith again, <hi>But when the Comforter comes, even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> John 15. 26. <hi>And if I go not away, the Comforter will not come, but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you,</hi> John 16. 7. <hi>And I have many things to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them now; howbeit, when he, the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth,</hi> John 16. 12, 13. Here it may be ſeen, that they who followed Chriſt without, and not received the Spirit within, could not bear what he had to ſpeak unto them; and alſo, it may be ſeen, that when the Spirit was come, it would be better with them.</p>
               <p>And much more might be mentioned, how Chriſt foretold,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66375:120"/> what was to come, and be received, and revealed in that day, <hi>John</hi> 16. 23. when the Spirit ſhould be poured forth according to the Prophets, all which plainly declare, and moſt evidently ſet forth, how <hi>Chriſt in his Miniſtry, when he was upon Earth, did moſt chiefly direct unto the Miniſtration of the Spirit of Truth,</hi> which was then yet to come; and that they might not run to teach others (as many do now) before they had received the Spirit of Truth in themſelves, by and with that to be led into all Truth, but might receive the Power of Truth in themſelves, from the Life thereof, to convert others into the ſame; therefore ſaid he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after he was riſen again, <hi>But tarry ye in the City of</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>until you be enducd with Power from on high,</hi> Mark 24. 4. ſo that though they had ſeen his Body before, and had now ſeen him after his Reſurrection, yet that and all the reſt was not enough without the Power and the Spirit, which was to come, which they were to wait for: And ſo, now men ſhould tarry, wait and ſtand ſtill to ſee the Salvation of God, and until they receive the Spirit; for <hi>it is the Spirit,</hi> (not the Body) <hi>which ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, and ſheweth plainly of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this before-written in ſhort, I have a little endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew unto the meek and ſingle-hearted, That <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was upon the Earth, directed unto Chriſt; As in theſe words,</p>

               <p>And <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he was upon Earth, directed unto the Spirit, which was to come, in the like words, ſaying,</p>

                  <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, being yet preſent with you, but the Comforter, which is the holy Spirit, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things,</hi> John 14. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>And then, what if I did write after the manner of men, and ſay, If <hi>Moſes</hi> were now upon the Earth, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his own Body upon the Earth; and <hi>Moſes</hi> with all his Prieſts, Tythes and Offerings, and Religion, which diſcovers ſin, but makes nothing perfect, which <hi>Paul</hi> profited much in; if he, I ſay, ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and exhort all People under his Miniſtry, to go to Chriſt, and hear him.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:66375:120"/>
               <p>And if Chriſt were now upon Earth, and notwithſtanding his outward Miracles, Circumciſion, Baptiſm, Supper and Death, yet he ſhould command and exhort all (that come through the Law or Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto him) to look, and tarry, and wait for another Comforter, that they might receive the Spirit in them, and ſay unto them, that <hi>that ſhould teach them all things, and lead them into all Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then whether or no, People were to continue following <hi>Moſes</hi> Prieſts, with their Tythes and long Prayers, and ſtill be ſeeking the Law at their Mouth, or to come to Chriſt, to ſeek the Goſpel? for <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf did not ſay, that they ſhould ſeek the Goſpel at the Prieſts Mouth: And then, when did the Prieſts ever preach the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>And then, whether thoſe obey not <hi>Moſes,</hi> who leave the Prieſts and come to Chriſt (the Light?) And whether ſuch, when they are come to Chriſt, ſhould alwayes be looking and following after Water, Baptiſm and outward Supper, or tarry and wait to receive the Spirit within them?</p>
               <p>And then, which of theſe now, ſhould all People that profeſs Chriſt, be led by in theſe dayes, either <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit of Truth?</hi> And, whether ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and are truly indeed led by his Spirit of Truth, and know that to be their Teacher, and follow it, and are ruled, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and guided by it, according to the command of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> do not hereby obey the command of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and fulfill their Doctrine? And whether any other People or Profeſſors whatſoever, do obey the command of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but only ſuch? And whether this be not a thing of great Concernment to be known and learned by all that profeſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?</p>
               <p>But why then do People follow theſe Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> any longer, which are contrary to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who have no Store-houſes, but ſuffer the Poor to want within and without, and the Widdow and Stranger ready to periſh, and moreover devour, and can never have enough of the Spoil of other mens Goods?</p>
               <p>And why do others diſpute about, and talk of the Body ſo much, which they know not? And is it not better to be ſilent,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66375:121"/> and know the true God and Jeſus Chriſt, who dwells in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Spirit of Truth, which he requires in the inward parts, and to feel after God, even the Life in themſelves, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>They were ſaved by his Life, being before reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his Death, Rom.</hi> 5. 10. And until the Life came, there were many things which they were not ſaved from, and the Death which reconcileth was paſſed through, and the Life was received again to ſave and juſtifie.</p>
               <p>And why then are People ſo much buſied about that which was before the Reconciliation (and ſo therein much ſhort of the Life) and for outward <hi>Bread, Wine</hi> and <hi>Water?</hi> Are not theſe things which are ſeen? And are not the things that are ſeen Temporal?</p>
               <p>But Chriſt the true Prophet being come, of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> did write, who is the end of the Law, and ſo the end of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, whereby that is done away for the weakneſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs thereof, and Chriſt coming after <hi>John,</hi> of whom <hi>John</hi> bare witneſs, <hi>that he was before, and greater, and came after him;</hi> and Chriſt having finiſhed that which he himſelf came to do; and likewiſe ſo largely and often exhorted, <hi>to wait for another Comforter, even the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then what Miniſtration is it that now ſtandeth and remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And whether all they be not compaſſed about with a Cloud of Error, who are uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Miniſtry of the Law, (or a worſe) which Chriſt is the end of, and the Apoſtles ſaid was done away; and likewiſe ſuch as are upholding and keeping up that which Chriſt ſaid he had finiſhed? And whether the upholding of ſuch things now, be not quite oppoſite both to <hi>Moſes, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Scriptures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And being that <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor indeed his true Miniſters of the Law, <hi>are not upon Earth,</hi> neither that Body of Chriſt, (which by the Profeſſors was murthered at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) viſibly to be ſeen <hi>upon Earth;</hi> Then what was it that thoſe have to follow, who have not received the <hi>Spirit to be led by?</hi> and if they will ſay, <hi>They have the Writings of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Words of Chriſt:</hi> I ſay, if that be all, then they that forſook and denyed Chriſt had more

               <p>And ſo, what is all their Religion worth, who are not come to the Spirit? And whether <hi>Moſes</hi> Miniſtration being ended by Chriſt, and Chriſt alſo having finiſhed his Work, are not all People in the firſt place now to wait for the Spirit, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit by it, then to be led into all Truth; and ſo being firſt led into the Truth, then in the ſame Truth to worſhip God in the Spirit, who is a Spirit? And whether there be now any true Worſhip ſtanding which God accepteth, but only this? And whether this alone be not agreeable to <hi>Moſes, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi> And then, whether all other Worſhip now upheld, be not contrary to this true Worſhip of God, and contrary to <hi>Moſes, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and indeed chiefly oppoſite to the Spirit of God, whereby he is grieved? And if ſo, whether all ſuch Worſhip, Way, Practice, Performances, Duties and Ordinances (ſo called) be not better left undone, than perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until God's Spirit be received to guide therein?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Miniſtry were viſible, and Chriſt in the form of a Servant (and ſo like unto <hi>Moſes</hi>) was viſible, and ſo was his Miracles, and that which is viſible to the Natural Eye, the Carnal Mind can come to profeſs, and contend about, but the bleſſed Eye, which God openeth with the Light, cometh to ſee, the one done away, and the other finiſhed by Chriſt the Light and Life.</p>
               <p>And this Spirit is that which firſt moved, and yet moveth, and moved unto, and led through the viſible Miniſtration; and this Spirit is inviſible, as it is written, <hi>The Inviſible only Wiſe God,</hi> whom no Eye of Fleſh hath ſeen, or can ſee, and this moving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Spirit of God, which is without limit or end, is that which all People ſhould be led unto, by all its outward viſible
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66375:122"/> Appearances, Miniſtrations and Diſpenſations, and this Spirit was that which gave forth and ordained the Miniſtration of the the Law, which was glorious in its time, though to be done away; but how much more glorious is the Miniſtration of that Spirit of Life it ſelf, from which the Miniſtration of the Law came, which Spirit abideth forever? And the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is made a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit, and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Word,</hi> was with God, and was God, before the Body of Fleſh was made, and that Spirit abideth forever, as it heard out of the Law, <hi>He ſhall abide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;</hi> and this is that which ever liveth to intercede.</p>
               <p>And this forever bleſſed inviſible Spirit was before time, and is to be when time ſhall be no more, and is without limit, an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lively ſubſtance, giving Life from it ſelf, and ſecretly cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf from the carnal part of man, not ſeen nor underſtood, but by ſuch as by its ſecret motions come to be led to ſee through that which ſhadows it forth, and by the Image, Form, Shadow or Figure, to diſcern the ſubſtance, which is the Life, where Immortality dwelleth; for in the moſt innermoſt and ſecrets of all, is the Life of all, being covered over with that in which it lies; through the which it breaking forth in any diſcovery of it ſelf, is that whereby the Beholders might be drawn through the diſcovery to it ſelf, which in the diſcovery broke forth; for the diſcovery was ſtill too ſhort of that from whence it came, and that which was diſcovered forth in any Shadow, Form or Image, was not to be idolized nor ſet up, for the very thing or ſubſtance of Life, from whence it proceeded; and herein hath been much miſtake by ſuch who came not by that which opened in the Viſibles, to that from whence it came, in that to have their Underſtandings opened, and thereby to be made ſenſible of that which is Eternal, by it to be brought in, where its indwellings abide forever, whoſe breakings forth in the viſible (which was to draw to that inviſible) refreſhed the Soul inviſibly, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected time; but being (after) ſought for in the Viſibles (and not in the Eternal) with-draws it ſelf out of the Viſibles, and out of the ſight and reach of that which ſeeks it there, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that which is to live forever with it, may come through all that which it appeared in, unto the very thing and inviſible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelf, which is the Life of all, and the true center of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66375:122"/> living Motion, which moveth of it ſelf, and gave forth all things good, as they proceeded from it, by virtue of its gradual and various Motions; and this being come, openeth it ſelf in them that find it, and live therein; and this maketh Darkneſs Light before the People whoſe dwelling is with God, and the crooked comes to be made ſtraight by the thing it ſelf, and dark Sayings of old come to be opened, and ſecret things revealed.</p>
               <p>But to write more plain, for the ſake of the weak, of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious indwelling Spirit, which in the fulneſs of time cometh forth in Fleſh, laying hold of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the moſt glorious appearance that ever was, being thus appeared was the expreſs Image of God, who dwelleth in his People, whoſe Bodies are Fleſh and earthly Tabernacles; but by the operation of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying cleanſing Spirit, which the Father ſendeth, are made fit Habitations of God, and ſo Co-heirs with Chriſt, and Members of his Body, Fleſh and Bones, which Spirit quickneth to God; and being thus received and obeyed, is felt to live forever, though the ſhadowings forth of it be done away; and this is Eternal, and never endeth, but abideth with ſuch forever, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it is Life it ſelf to the Soul, and more to be valued and deſired than all that ever was ſeen before it.</p>
               <p>And as the Lord took off that Spirit which was upon <hi>Moſes</hi> and put it upon his Brethren, the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereby they might rule and judge with him; ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The Father ſhall take off mine, and give unto you,</hi> even of that Spirit of Love, Life, Power, Valour and Virtue, which was upon and in him (that was like unto <hi>Moſes</hi>) is miniſtred into, and put upon ſuch as are truly his Brethren and Friends, whereby him with they (thus gifted, ſanctified and qualified) judge the World; <hi>for all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is committed to the Son;</hi> and of that which the Son hath (and is committed to him) doth the Father give unto his Members: And ſo, from Chriſt the Head, they come to receive Power over the World, and its Way, Worſhip and Faſhions, and over Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits. And that is an Unclean Spirit which will lead into any Sin, and it is an unclean Spirit in which ſin ſtandeth, and which pleadeth for the continuance and upholding of that which is unclean, and that is of the World, which the Saints judge.</p>
               <p>And as thoſe Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who were of the Church in the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66375:123"/> Wilderneſs) were not made fit to judge nor rule in outward mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by all the writings and words of the Law (though received by diſpoſition of Angels) until the Lord himſelf took off that Spirit which was upon <hi>Moſes</hi> and put upon them.</p>
               <p>So thoſe that profeſs to be Elders in the Church now, or any other Perſon whatſoever, are much leſs made fit to rule or judge in ſpiritual matters, by all the reading and profeſſing <hi>Moſes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Chriſts words, and the reſt of the holy Scriptures (though they were given by the Inſpiration of God) until the Lord take off that Spirit, which was upon and in Chriſt (who is like unto <hi>Moſes</hi>) and give unto, and pour it upon, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it unto them. And this is done in Gods way (which is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) and time (which is in his own hand) to thoſe whom he accounteth worthy thus to Honour, and who truly wait for it, as a Wayfaring man for a Reſting place, and as a Captive for Deliverance.</p>
               <p>And though Chriſt (after his Reſurrection) ſaid, <hi>All Power in Heaven and in Earth is given unto me, go ye therefore and Teach;</hi> yet they were to tarry until they had the Power in themſelves; and when that was come, which they were to tarry and wait for, then with that they went and taught the Nations, from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible feeling of that which taught them how to teach, and all things elſe, when the ſame Spirit and Power was upon them, which was before committed unto him; and ſo the coming forth of it from him into them, and filling them therewith, was to them in that work of the Miniſtry moſt effectual, like as the Virtue going forth of Chriſt healed the Woman; ſo the Power and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the holy Spirit coming forth from Chriſt, being ſent of the Father, and received by the Diſciples (who with much deſire waited for that) impowered them to do that which before they were commanded to do, after they were endued with Power (or had the Power in them) And ſo, what they were commanded to do, they were to wait to receive Power in themſelves, from God to perform; and Chriſt did intend to give them Power to do that which he commanded: And as he commanded them to go and teach, he alſo required them to tarry (and ſo not to go) until they had received Power ſo to do; and ſo it was the Power of the holy Ghoſt in them which made them Miniſters; and theſe were,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66375:123"/> and ſuch are truly Ordained Miniſters: And after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Power from on high, even the Spirit (or Life) of Truth, and were filled therewith, and ſo had it in them, then they went to do that which was commanded them; then they went to teach the Nations, and converted Thouſands, and turned Sinners, and brought Souls to God, and then they were called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and then were People brought to be of the true Church, which Chriſt buildeth upon, that which fleſh and blood reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</p>
               <p>And this is the entrance into the Church of God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>the receiving of the Spirit,</hi> and in this God is worſhipped, and not elſe; for this hath excluded all other Worſhip, and thoſe only are the true Worſhippers, who come in thus by the Door, which is Chriſt, the Light and Spirit of Truth, ſent into the Heart from God.</p>
               <p>And if all the prudent learned Divines (ſo called) in <hi>Europe,</hi> or all, or any of the wiſeſt Orthodox men in any other Quarter of the whole World, can prove (by the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament) any other true Worſhip of God (who is a Spirit) now extant among men, and to be performed (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally among them called <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) with acceptance to God, <hi>but only that which the Spirit of Truth leadeth ſuch unto, as receive it;</hi> then let them bring it forth that we may ſee it, and prove it by plain undeniable Truth of Scripture; or otherwiſe I ſhall look upon their Proofs, Words, Ways, Actions, Practices, Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, Duties and ſeveral Worſhips as things of no value.</p>
               <p>Or if there be any other entrance into the true Worſhip of God than this Spirit that God ſendeth (or the Light which lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it) or if there be any other Worſhip which God doth or will accept to be after this, ſpoken or propheſied of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth, whereby this ſhall ever be done away, or ended from being the true, only, and alone Worſhip of God, whilſt men have a being upon Earth, then let the wiſeſt of the Sons of men bring it forth, and produce there ſtrong reaſons therein, that we may plead together, and that the entrance into, and the true Worſhip it ſelf, of the only true inviſible God, may be declared over all the World, for the ſatisfaction of every tender Heart concerning this.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:66375:124"/>
               <p>For this I am ſatisfied in, that Chriſt Jeſus (who is the end of the Law, and who finiſhed his work, when he was upon Earth) is made a quickning Spirit, and is the Way and Truth of Life, which bringeth into the Worſhip of God, and he is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the end, and he leadeth to the beginning of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and he is the end and the Reſt of all the faithful, in whom all the Promiſes are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> and without him all is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and all that come before him are Thieves and Robbers, and he it is that abideth a Prieſt forever, and his Spirit of Truth is it which all People and Profeſſors whatſoever, ſhould firſt wait to receive, thereby to be led into that true Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which alone God accepteth, leſt they and their Worſhip and Building fall together, in a day when there is none to deliver.</p>
               <p>And then thus I will Query; If Chriſt own dear Diſciples, who had forſook all and followed him, (<hi>not Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Baptiſts</hi>) did not come to receive this Spirit, by hearing all the words which he he ſpoke unto them, but by waiting after the words were ended? Then whether thoſe that have not forſaken all (nor ſo much as the Worlds faſhions) do now come to receive the Spirit by Reading, Hearing or Profeſſing the ſame words of Chriſt, now written, or any other part of Scriptures?</p>
               <p>Or, whether a Proud man hath received this Spirit, or a Lyar, or a Prophane perſon, or any Wiſe or Prudent man whatſoever, by any means or way of his? And whether any ſuch ever did, have, can, or may by any induſtry, or other way or means attain to this Spirit which leadeth in the true Worſhip of God, but as it is freely given forth from God? And then, whether all people are not to be led by that Spirit (which God freely giveth) into the Worſhip of God; becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The Spirit ſhould lead,</hi> which indeed doth lead into all Truth, and nothing elſe doth ſo? And they that have not received this from God to lead them, are not yet come to be led by that which the Sons and Children of God were and are led by.</p>
               <p>And the Miniſtration of the Spirit, which all are now to be taught by, is inwardly to be known, in the moſt neareſt, ſecret, inviſible manner, and is more out of the ſight, Comprehenſion and reach of mans Wiſdom, than any other Miniſtration, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66375:124"/> it is given forth from the clear Fountain it ſelf, unto the Souls ſatisfaction of man, when he is come to the end of words; or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard much, or all the words that can be ſpoken of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth unſatisfied, in a reſtleſs longing deſire to find, receive, feel and enjoy the thing it ſelf, which the words declared of; and that which ſatisfieth the true thirſting Soul, comes clearly from God to the refreſhing of the inward parts of man, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the empty, barren, hungry Spirit, which cannot be ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And the ſecret inviſible hand of God, whoſe Power was and is felt in my heart, having out of the ſight of fleſh and blood, in the hidden counſel of his ſecret Will, led me by the vertue of the operation and drawings thereof, through thoſe things, which thereby I come to leave behind, and to receive, and feel that which now goeth before, and is my Leader in whoſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Life Eternal, my Soul is now ſatisfied; and ſo by good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Lords leading, and from an experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſible feeling, and preſent enjoyment of the incomes of the Spirit of Truth and Life, which filleth the inward parts with the holineſs of it ſelf, and giveth power to do the things required before of God, even from the right and good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, is this written; That where it meets with the like condition in a wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Concerning the great City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Beheld all her Waters, which belonged to her frozen up, and that exceeding hard, and the Veſſels which went upon them, ſo that I and others paſſed over her Waters without the leaſt danger, &amp; over the greateſt Veſſels which had carried her Merchandize; for all was frozen with a mighty Freezing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all her goodly Merchandize were ſtopt, and her mighty ſwift
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66375:126"/> Waters were turned into a mighty think frozen Ice, which ſtood ſtill, ſo that her pleaſant Streams ran not.</p>
               <p>And as for the City her ſelf, and her Suburbs, and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to her, a Fire was kindled therein, but ſhe knew not how, even in her goodly places, and the kindling of it was in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of her buildings, and there was none could quench it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any able, and the burning thereof was exceeding great, and it burned inward in a hidden manner, which cannot be expreſſed; and the Fire conſumed Foundations which the City ſtood upon, and the tall buildings fell, and it conſumed all the lofty things therein, and the fire ſearched out all the hidden places, and burned moſt in ſecret places, but the Conſumation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, where with it conſumed.</p>
               <p>And as I paſſed through her ſtreets, I beheld her ſtate to be very miſerable, and very few were thoſe that were left in her, who were but here and there one, and they feared not the Fire, neither did the burnings hurt them, but they were (and walked) as mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dejected People, and the fire burned every where, ſo that there was no eſcaping of it; And thus ſhe became a Deſolation, and as an Aſtoniſhment; for the burning was ſuffered of God for her chaſtizement, and could never be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>enched nor overcome; and in the midſt of her Waters was the Veſſel of her Merchandize frozen up, that none could move it, and there were none that could ſtop the burning; and the Fire conſumed all things, both Stone and Timber, and it burned under all things, and under all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and that which was lifted up above it fell down, and the Fire conſumed it, and the burning continued; for though the Foundation was burnt up, and all the lofty part brought down (by the fire) yet there was much old ſtuff, and part of broken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Walls and Buildings in the midſt, which the fire continued burning againſt; and that which was taken, as to make uſe of, which yet eſcaped the fire, became uſeleſs in mans hand, as a thing of nought. And the Viſion hereof remained in me as a thing that was ſecretly ſhewed me of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now let her Wiſe men find out the matter, and her Prudent men read, and her Divines (ſo called) interpret the Viſion (and let her know, that her day is at hand) and let every one of them look to their own ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for thee, O City of <hi>London,</hi> thy Sin hath been exceeding
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66375:126"/> grievous, and thy Iniquities beyond meaſure; Who can number thy daily Tranſgreſſions, or ſet before thee the multitude of thy Abominations? Oh! thy wayes have grieved the Lord, and thy works have oppreſſed the Juſt, and the Lord will ſurely plead with thee, whom thou haſt long rebelled againſt, and walked in thy Pride, and nouriſhed thy ſelf in Voluptuouſneſs, as a Beaſt for the ſlaughter, and in Arrogancy hath thy ſteps been found; Oh! thy Heart hath been defiled, and thy wayes are wayes of Grievouſneſs, and thy paths are polluted before the Lord, and thou haſt not done the thing that is juſt in his ſight, but haſt choſen thy own Wayes, and truſted in thy own Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Take heed now therefore, O City of <hi>London,</hi> for God will be too ſtrong for thee, and thy ſtrength ſhall fall before him, and thou muſt come to an Account for thy Deeds, and then where will be thy Refuge, or what ſhall be thy Shelter? Will thy Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men deliver thee from God, or the Greatneſs of thy ſtrength prevail againſt the Almighty? If ſo, then mayeſt thou ſtand in thy Wayes, O City of <hi>London!</hi> but if not, thy Miſery will be great; and who ſhall bemoan thee in that day, or pity thee in the time of thy Diſtreſs? Foraſmuch as thou haſt refuſed the counſel of the Lord, and rejected the voice of his Servants in the midſt of thee, and hearkened not to his Word in thy own Bowels, but alſo ſlighted the many VVarnings of the Lord by his Servants, who were ſent of him in love to thee, that thou mighteſt come to ſerve him, and not thy own Pleaſure, proceeding on from Year to Year, like a monſtrous Woman, who regardeth not the Voice nor Perſon of Husband nor Friend: Oh! what ſhall be ſaid unto thee? Muſt thou needs be left for Deſolation? And muſt thou be left as a Woman forſaken? Will thy Lovers help thee in the Day of Trouble? or thy delightſom Pleaſures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy Heart from Judgment, or thy glorious Riches hide thee from the burning Torments? If thou loveſt thy Wages of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity more than God, and thy Hearts luſt more than thy Maker, and wilt not turn ſpeedily from it to ſeek the Lord in thy Heart, then mayſt thou poſt on (as thou art going) haſtily to the Pit, and with much eagerneſs to the Gulf of Miſery, where none can help thee: And then will thy Feaſting be turned into Famine, thy Beauty into Duſt, thy Glory into Shame, and thy Honour
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66375:127"/> into Contempt, as thou haſt ſeen it come to paſs upon others, whoſe Glory and Strength was as great as thine, by whom thou haſt not taken warning by a thorow and ſpeedy returning unto the Lord with all thy Heart.</p>
               <p>Therefore will God ſearch thee and judge thee according to what is found in the midſt of thee, and thou shalt be awakened in the day of God's anger, and be ſenſible of the Torment when it cometh: For though God hath alſo tryed thee, with giving thee thy Hearts deſire, yet haſt thou not been thereby humbled; and though the Lord hath viſited thee in loving-kindneſs, yet haſt thou walked loftily; nay, moreover thou haſt taken occaſion thereby to be the more exalted, and art going in the Steps of them that the Lord ſo lately (for ſuch things) overturned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, that it cannot yet be forgotten; And doſt thou or the Rules in thee think to eſtabliſh your ſelves by acting ſuch things, for which God overtured many mightier then you? Therefore, O City! think not to eſtabliſh thy ſelf by Blood, nor to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by way of Revenge; for though ſome men may have done ſome things unjuſt againſt ſome of you, (and others) ſo that God may juſtly by you ſcourge them ſore for it; yet wherein you do it in the way of Revenge, or to Avenge your own cauſe, or to ſet up your ſelves in Self-ends, like them before you, therein God will alſo find out a Scourge for you. And this I have ſeen, that the Great men of the Earth ſtand in ſlippery places, and their great ſtrength before the Lord is as Smoke before the Wind.</p>
               <p>My counſel is therefore, <hi>That thou fear the Lord, and turn from the Way thou art in;</hi> and let thy Judges know, that the Lord will judge them; and let thy Rulers underſtand, that the Lord will rule over their Strength and Wiſdom; and let thy Teachers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that God is come to teach his own Children. And let the Kings Heart be upright before the Lord in this the day of his Tryal, and time of Viſitation from God, (<hi>the ſhortneſs or length thereof being hid from him, over whom God ruleth as it pleaſeth him</hi>) who is cutting his Work short in Righteouſneſs: Therefore let all thy Inhabitants, <hi>O thou great City!</hi> from the higheſt to the loweſt, take good heed unto their Wayes, and the Intents which are in them, for the Lord ſeeth the Secrets of all your Hearts.</p>

               <p>In my former Viſion, in the dayes of the former Rulers, I ſaw on a Hill many Trees together ſtanding, which were both great and tall, but they were very old, and of a long ſtanding, and many of their lofty Boughs were broken and battered, and many hanged downward, which preſſed down the Trees, and they were old, withering and decaying, and had not grown a long time, and were but as a Wonder to the Beholders, though they had been of great account, and the chief Trees among (or over) the reſt; and it was ſo, that I beheld them much even with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, to ſee ſuch Trees in ſuch a ſtate, which was more to this purpoſe than is here expreſt; and I beheld until all theſe Trees were rooted up out of the Earth, and ſo overturned every one, and their dead Bodies lay in a confuſed manner, and were fallen one upon another, and the Ground upon which they ſtood was broken up, and then there was ſome room and liberty, and Light came in, and I walked and looked every way, both upon the Light, and the great Deſolation of theſe great Ones. <hi>The Interpretation whereof may be read by ſuch as can but ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though this great overturning befell thoſe great, tall and ſtrong Trees, and that light came into that Ground, over which thoſe fruitleſs Trees ſtood, yet I beheld round about, and near unto it much Briars, Brambles and Thorns in abundance, which covered the Earth; and it was ſuch Rubbiſh, that it was never
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66375:128"/> like to be fit for any thing but to have a Fire kindled among it; and it was ſo thick and ſo ſtrong that there was no paſſing in nor through it, but only where the narrow Way was, and there alſo thoſe Briars would catch on every ſide; and he that paſſed through muſt ſtoop very low. <hi>And what thoſe Briars and Thorns were, let thoſe Brambles read, who covered the Earth with their Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, in Raging, Swearing, Curſing, Shouting, Roaring and Drinking the Health (as they call it) of their King at his coming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And near unto the place of the Deſtruction of thoſe great Trees, was there a Child in great Deſolation, in a cloſe place, where it had been a long time, and was not like yet to be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but remained in want and miſery, which mine Eye pitied, and in Irons, and my Heart was ſadned for it, and the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none came to viſit it, nor ſuccour it; for it was in a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late place, and unſeemly, and few had regard unto it, and yet there was ſome hopes it might be delivered. <hi>And this was a true reſemblance of the ſtate of the Seed of God in all the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in plainneſs concerning <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and his Son <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> (late called) <hi>Protectors,</hi> the Viſion from God was ſhewed to me, (before the downfall of either of them) thus:</p>
               <p>And I beheld a great and mighty Tree, much bigger than ever I ſaw before, and appearing without Sap or Virtue in it, or Leaf, Bough or Branch upon it, (much leſs Fruit) and the top of it was broad, (being all big) much like unto the top of <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple in <hi>London;</hi> and cloſe by this great old Tree, grew up another Tree, as out of his Root, and belonged to him, but not both in one Body, though very near together, and ſtood both upon one Foundation, and this was as a little ſtripling Tree, which alſo was without Leaves or Branches, or any thing to bear Fruit, ſo that I admired to ſee it ſo with the young Tree; for I looked for Branches or Leaves, but there were none.</p>
               <p>And whilſt I was beholding of them, a Man being ſent came in much haſte, with an Ax in his hand, to cut down the great mighty old Tree, which ſeemed ſtrange to me, that one man ſhould adventure upon ſo great a work, to cut down ſuch a Tree as that; for the lower part of the Tree was exceeding big, and almoſt as broad upon the Earth as half the height; ſo that I thought he had need of three or more to help him, and that one
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66375:128"/> man could ſcarce cut him down with one Ax, if he ſtood hewing all his Life time: But I much more admired to ſee the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the man that came with ſpeed with his Ax, who made no ſtop at all, becauſe of the greatneſs of him, nor any thing elſe, but as ſoon as ever he could get to him ſmote with the edge of his Ax, and ſtruck between the Ground and the Tree, ſo that I ſoon perceived he intended to ſeparate between the Tree and the Ground on which he ſtood; and the man in the might of his ſtrength ſtruck but three Blows in all, but he ſeparated the Tree from the Earth on which he ſtood, and immediately the Tree fell with a mighty overthrow, and the Foundation of the Tree was altogether rotten, and not one Root at all, but where the Root ſhould be was Rottenneſs, and the Earth ſhook at his fall, and many Great men ſtood amazed, and fear ſeized on many, becauſe of the great ſudden fall thereof.</p>
               <p>And as this great Tree fell, I ſaw under the Foundation of the young tall Tree that ſtood near the other, and it was much like to fall preſently after, and was almoſt down on the one hand, and then almoſt down on the other, and yet it recovered and ſtood up for a time, having no Root but Rottenneſs: And the great Tree fell from him on the one ſide, and the Earth parted from him on two ſides more, ſo that only upon one ſide in four (or leſs) the Earth cleaved to him, and he being ſlender and tall without Root, was not like long thus to ſtand; <hi>neither did Richard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I likewiſe beheld many more ſmaller Trees, and the man with his Ax in his Hand cut them all down at the Butt, ſomewhat above the Ground, and ſo left the Stumps in the Earth, and therefore it might be poſſible for them to grow up again: <hi>As ſome did come up again who were put down, but fell the ſecond time through Diſobedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after all this I beheld alſo many more Trees in abundance, yea, more numerous then the other, coming up out of the Earth, and covering the face thereof, and growing up apace, which were not yet ready to be cut down; and I ſaw the man with the Ax in his hand, ſtanding ſtill for a time (having cut all the other) until thoſe ſhould be ready to be cut down; and he waited till the time came, and was in a readineſs with his Ax in his hand ready to ſtrike, when thoſe abundance of Trees ſhould come up
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66375:129"/> to their growth, which haſtened. And let thoſe who are now come up read this, and let the whole City of <hi>London</hi> take heed (as I ſaid before) and Repent with ſpeed, and turn to the Lord, whoſe Servant I am, called.</p>

            <p>THe Lord is become our Portion, and the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> the Lot of our Inheritance, even the God of the whole Earth, whoſe Throne is in the Heavens, &amp; his Dwelling in the Hearts of the Humble, before whom the leaſt Lamb of his Fold is more delightſom than the beautifulſt Flower of the Graſs of the Field, and of more value than the Fowls of the Air, or many Sparrows, which are according to his Providence; the Myſtery of whoſe Will lodgeth in the ſecret Chambers of his Wiſdom, whoſe Wayes are unſearchable, and his goings in the deep; none can fathom the unſearchable Fountain of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor find out the utmoſt of the Intents of his Heart, but as Love ſprings up with healing Oyl, diſcovering a meaſure of the Motions of his Spirit, whereby ſomething of his Mind is known, who inhabiteth Eternity, and is dreadful in Holineſs, ſevere in his Judgments, clear in his Love, free in his Mercy, bountiful in his Goodneſs, large in his fatherly loving Kindneſs, wonderful in his Operation, pitiful to the Meek, gentle to the Upright in Heart, rewarding the greateſt of his Adverſaries according to the fruit of their own Ways, and altogether Righteous in all his Doings, from whom the Upright may certainly expect a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reward, and all his Servants the Wages of Righteouſneſs, and every one of the leaſt of his Children a certain Inheritance with the ſanctified in the Kingdom that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>Even this is the Lord our Righteouſneſs, whom the World knoweth not, who alſo appeared unto them, who were truly our Fathers in the dayes of old, who is the ſame both in Wiſdom, Strength and Power as ever he was, and it is he that found us in the waſte howling Wilderneſs, and toſſed to and fro with the unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66375:130"/> Waves, on which the Whore ſate, that brought into Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and with his holy Arm did he bring us out of the Miery Clay, and my Soul from under the deep Waters, and ſet our feet upon the certain Rock of Ages, that Men, Laws nor Decrees can never remove, and he hath been unto us a Shield, and will certainly be an exceeding great Reward, or a Reward that ſhall exceed and ſurmount all the contrary: What ſhall I ſay? what he will be unto the faithful can never be uttered, what he hath been in his Power, Wiſdom and Love to us, we have ſeen, and what he is, let all my <hi>Brethren</hi> feel, and this we are moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured of, that he is become ours, yea, even our own, and we have a part in him that is true, our Covenant with him ſtands in the Power of his Life, which is endleſs, and he hath bought us with the price of that which puts away the Sin; and certainly I cannot but glorifie him even in the Body, Soul and Spirit, and no other Lover doth my Soul deſire, nor a better Shepherd can <hi>Iſrael</hi> ever find, nor a more wiſe, ſtronger and tender Father can Children ever have, nay, he himſelf (as I have ſaid) is become the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the portion of our Cup, in which Salvation ſtandeth, of which we daily drink, and know it to be the Cup of bleſſing, and can truly ſay, our lot is fallen in a good ground.</p>
            <p>I can truly ſay, my Soul cleaveth unto the Lord, who bringeth Deliverance, and hitherto the Lord hath helped us, and hath done greater things than could have been by man expected; and what, now though there be a Sea to paſs through, and Floods of ungodly men to get beyond, ſhall we therefore be diſcouraged, or ſhall we murmur becauſe of the length of time, or be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented when the Lord brings his People into Tryals, for a two fold end or purpoſe, as in himſelf, that is to ſay, <hi>For the proving and humbling of his People, that he may do them good, or much more good than he hath done at their latter end; And for the drawing forth of the Cruelty and Tyranny of his Enemies to the utmoſt, which was in them before, or grounded in their Hearts, that their Sin being finiſhed, he might deſtroy them forever, and overturn them, ſo that they never riſe again?</hi> Or ſhall we be unſatisfied becauſe the People of the Land of Darkneſs do ſhut us up out from amongſt them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dread and trouble that is upon them? Or ſhall we not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66375:130"/> be contented if the Lord ſhould ſuffer us to be deprived of all things but himſelf, that we might have none other thing to have unity with, but only him alone? ſurely this would be his Love, and great would be the Unity between ſuch and him!

And what if we had none but him, even the Lord our God, to take care for our Bodies (who cauſeth the Rayment not to wax old, and the Widdows Oyl to encreaſe, and gave Bread from Heaven in the needful time,) yet ſhould it go well with us; and though we had none other to truſt unto, then he who delivered his People after the Decree was ſealed for their Deſtruction in the days of <hi>Mordecai</hi> (who could not bow, though the King had commanded it) yet ſhould we not be diſcouraged; and though we had none other to cry in ſecret unto, but him that preſerved <hi>Daniel</hi> in praying to his God (though his Life thereby was in great Jeapordy, and the Decree of the King broken) yet might we have quietneſs and peace; yea, much better it is to enjoy the Lord, than life it ſelf, and the lowlineſs of his Countenance, than earthly Treaſure: Nay, truly let them take what they are for, and their Minds in, ſo we may but enjoy the Treaſures of Life Immortal, and the Crown of Everlaſting Peace, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66375:131"/> yet ſcattered Ones, <hi>Oh! that ye would come and ſee my Dwelling, and find out my Reſting place, and abide in the beautiful Habitation, and reſt in the munition of Rocks: Oh! that ye would come and drink of the everlaſting Streams, and be ſatisfied with the Springs of Virtue, that your Bones might be full of Marrow, and the inſide of your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings beautiful, ſo ſhall the Lord delight in you forever; and though the World hate, yet he will love, and though Relations may deny, yet he will own, though Riches may take themſelves Wings, yet he will never forſake; nay, though mortal Parents might caſt off, yet then the Lord will not caſt off, but receive; and though Wives or Huſbands may break their Promiſe, and ſo be without natural affection, yet the Lord will never break his Covenant with his People, for that ſhall laſt for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; and though Children might for ſake their Parents, the Lord will be more unto them than ten Sons.</hi> So that I ſay again, were I in one day bereaved of all, and ſeperated from my Fathers Children, which of all outward things are moſt dear unto me, yet enjoying the Lord, and his Preſence being with me, in whoſe Covenant I am with all the flock of God, in the inviſible Life, ſo ſhould it be well with me, and ſo may it be well with all you, as ye are faithful to God in the ſuffering ſtate, and ſo enjoy his Preſence; thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with you for evermore may it go well.</p>
            <p>Shall I now therefore return to Exhortation and Admonition, with deſires of tender Love towards you, that you all in patience may ſtand and look to the Lord, whom we have, and have none other in Heaven to hear our Cry, nor in Earth that truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerateth our Cauſe, nor hath Power like him to help. <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> he knoweth our Intents, and ſeeth how it is with us; he hath given to many of us an heart to ſay, <hi>Lord, if thou ſhouldſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to periſh, we will not leave thee; and whatever become of us, we dare not deny thee before men; for thou haſt called us, and we are thine, even thine own, whom thou haſt choſen:</hi> Let your deſires be forever thus unto the Lord, and wait upon him continually, and let your Eyes be more upon the Lord than upon thoſe things which in this day of Tryal are ſuffered to come to paſs by him, which he can alſo turn for his own Glory, and your Everlaſting Comfort.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> this know, that as your Minds are upon, and much caring how to preſerve the temporal things, the weight of them will lie upon you, and ſtop the Springs of better Treaſures,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66375:131"/> but as your Minds are towards the Lord, a great caſe and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction will be come unto you. And <hi>Friends,</hi> Murmur not that this day is come, for it may be there was need of it, even amongſt us, and it may be ye are more yet to be redeemed out of the earthly part and tranſitory things, and queſtion not but this will be for good; and as for Tryals, ſince this cloud was up, I have even drunk deep with you of the inward ſufferings, yea, more than is convenient to mention, but the Lord hath kept my feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock, and with all the Upright I ſing Praiſes to his Name.</p>
            <p>And now be tender one to another, you may read the Figure, God is bringing you near together, and <hi>Aegypt</hi> is thruſting you out, by reaſon of the Torment that is upon them, and a Land of Reſt is before you, and from the preſence of the Lord they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Baniſh us, nay, nor what they would neither, for God is on our ſide, though they have yet ſomething more to do; and when every mans Work is over, he ſhall certainly receive his Reward from God, either good or evil; and then, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith of the Wicked, <hi>They ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Preſence,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Friends,</hi> it is ſafe for you all to dwell in your own Tents, and mind the Lord, and let your love be towards him above all things, and in all things that you do, wait to feel his Counſel and Guidance, and truſt him forever, for great is the work of the Lord, yea, I have even looked for this day, that the Cry of the innocent may reach unto Heaven, and (as I have ſaid) the ſound thereof reach over <hi>Europe,</hi> that Kings may come to be crowned with Honour, and Judges decree Righteouſneſs, and true Judgment may ſtream forth as Water, and Righteouſneſs as a living ſtream, that Thouſands, and Thouſands of Thouſands may ſlock to our Fold as Doves to the Windows, that the Nations of men may bow under the Scepter of Righteouſneſs, and the Powers of Darkneſs ſhut up forever: Behold, O Friends! yea, ſtand ſtill and ſee the fall of <hi>Babel,</hi> the Deſtruction of the Whore, and the Torment of the Beaſt; for though Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, yet this we know, the Lord liveth, who ſcatters the Powers of Darkneſs: Oh! what more ſhall I ſay? who come to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66375:132"/> dwelling-place of its unutterable Power, may feel the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things of God.</p>
            <p>And Friends, let not the Enemy prevail through Unbelief, for there <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell in the days of old; and there is no greater danger than that of Unbelief: But conſider, that you have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtill to reſiſt, and ſeldom ever more than now; and you have a ſpiritual Enemy to war with, which flyes not but as he is reſiſted; and in the time of your weakneſs and inward trouble is his time to prevail, if ever; and if thou canſt ſtand then, full eaſie mayſt thou walk, when Refreſhings come, and with delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs mayſt thou perſevere, when the Cloud is over; and this know, that a Storm laſteth but for a time, and Winter is but for a ſeaſon, and the Night remains not always; nay, the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years had an end, and the Bounds of the Seas are ſet, and happy is he that always looketh unto him that ruleth over them; for though (when the Waves ſwelled) even the Diſciples were ready to think he cared not if they periſhed, yet he intended better things for them; and when for the Life's ſake they cryed unto him, he ſoon and eaſily abated the Rage both of Wind and Sea, and then the ſweetneſs of a Calm is prized. <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> I need not open the Parable unto you, but even rather ſay, The Lord be with you, even every one of you beyond all that I can write, and the Lord ſtrengthen you, and keep you ſtedfaſt in the Faith, and refreſh your Souls, and miniſter more ſtrength, virtue and comfort unto you all every where for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>And behold! ye Children of men, I cannot but proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you the Day which is near at hand, and warn you all to ſtrip your ſelves from your coverings, and ſit down, ye Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in Duſt and Aſhes, and confeſs your Iniquities in ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, before it be to late; for great is the Wo which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon you; and that which I have heard concerning you, is none other then a <hi>Voice of Terror:</hi> O the Trouble, Diſtreſs and Calamity that ſoundeth in my heart concerning you! and from the Lord God will it be poured forth, and exceeding deep ſhall you drink thereof; and this ſhall you know to be true, when the Whirlwind cometh from far, and the ſhadows of the Night

And are not your hearts yet hardened againſt Reproof? And are not to be reproved for your Envy againſt Gods People? Nay moreover, are you not ſometimes already reproved by him, who ſeeth in ſecret, and who ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Intents of the Heart, and maketh manifeſt unto man the Wicked Enterpriſes thereof, and overturneth the Counſels of the Wicked, but remembreth the Cauſe of the Needy, and pleadeth the Innocency of the Upright, in whoſe ſight the Death of the Saints is precious, and who pleadeth their Cauſe in the day of Trouble, and will moſt certainly confound his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſcatter his Enemies as ſmoke is ſcattered with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Whirlwind; and in that day, where then will your place be found?</p>
            <p>And a ſeed there is which God will deliver from your hands, and preſerve from the Blood-thirſty men, which ſhall grow up in the midſt of you as a Lilly among Thorns, and Gods bleſſing ſhall be upon them, with whom my Life is: And as the latter gleaning in the time of Harveſt, ſo ſhall the gathering of Gods Heritage be. And what you have done, will be for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſuffering Seed, and for the Glory of God, and much for your diſadvantage and eternal Shame, and endleſs Miſery, if you repent not. And this you men of ſin ſhould know, that inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as you have taken away the Life of Gods Creatures; and moreover, Unjuſtly by an Unrighteous Law deſtroyed the Lives of his Servants, therein may all men ſee, that you are contrary to Chriſt, and led by a Spirit oppoſite to him, <hi>who came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them.</hi>

            <p>And now, who will receive the Lamb, in whoſe Mouth there is no Guile? Who among the Sons of men will receive him that hath been ſlain from the Foundation of the World? Who will receive him that is the Gift of God, which is Perfect? Who will receive him that is a man of Sorrows, whoſe beauty is hid from the prudent of the Earth? Who will receive him, that the Prieſts cry out againſt and the Rulers ſay, <hi>Away with him from the Earth?</hi> Who will come unto the waters of Life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Fountain of living Mercies, that in his Belly the ſprings of Life may be felt? Who can endure to follow him to end of World, whoſe Kingdom is not of this World, and who receiveth not honour of men? Who can hear, receive and keep the hard ſayings, and drink his Blood that cleanſeth from all ſin? Who is willing to receive him that is the Reſurrection, and the Life, whoſe Preſence troubled and terrified his own Diſciples, ſo that their Hearts burned within them? VVho will lay down their Crowns at the foot of him that is the Light, and mourn over him that is ſlain, whom they have pierced, and through Patience, Long-ſuffering and Obedience, follow the one Shepherd in the Regeneration? even unto them is the VVord of Conſolation ſent.</p>
            <p>Therefore be ye awakned, O all ye Rulers and People! let not your Hearts be hardned againſt Gods VVitneſs in you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtop your Ears, nor cloſe your Eyes; for of a Truth the Lord is at hand, and is come to try you, with his Loving-kindneſs, and with his Judgments!

            <p>And all you People that are meek and tender, who have been taught by the Prieſts, and not by the Lord, whoſe Mercy to the humble abideth forever, the Lord God Almighty hath ſo loved you, that he hath provided a better Teacher for you, which ſhall not be removed, and a Prieſt that abideth forever, and a Biſhop for your Souls; and behold, he is no leſs then a <hi>King,</hi> yea, he ruleth over Kings, and help is laid upon him who is mighty, and he is able to ſave, and he is ſo willing to do it, that he hath laid down his Life for that end, and he ſtandeth at the Door and knocks, and he that knocks is called the <hi>Word,</hi> and the Word is as a hammer, and the Word is in the Heart, where Chriſt is to be received, and where this knocks for entrance, and it knocks againſt ſin, and in him is no ſin, and he cometh to ſave you from ſin, and to lead you the way to the Father; and without Money doth he ever teach, nay, he giveth abundantly unto all that are taught by him, and that more then mortal Riches, and you may have him to be with you alwayes forever, and he can reſolve all your Doubts, and ſatisfie every one, and repleniſh the weary, and nouriſh the faint, and in him are all Gods Treaſures, of the which by him you may come to partake forever, and he himſelf is as a Treaſure in thy field, but hid from thee, which I have found in the Earthen Veſſel, and declare it unto thee, that thy Fallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground may be ript up to find the Pearl; for this is near unto thee, and the motion of it is againſt thy ſin, the beauty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou canſt never ſee, until to it thou comeſt to hearken.</p>

               <p>WEre all (or the Major part) of the King's Subjects ſo in Unity one with another, that every man ſought each others good, as much as his own, and ſo fulfilled the Law of God therein, by each mans <hi>loving his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf,</hi> and <hi>doing unto all</hi> (and at all times) <hi>as they would be done unto;</hi> having the Bond of Peace upon their Hearts, by the power of his Spirit, who commanded the Chriſtians, not

               <p>And were they brought not to turn away their faces from their own fleſh, nor to ſlight the Cry of the Poor, but with an Eye of Pity ſtill to be commiſerating the Needy, and much caring how to have Oppreſſion removed, that ſo with the more chearfulneſs the Neceſſities of their poor Brethren might the eaſier be relieved, and ſuch continual Care to be taken herein, until all Oppreſſions were brought to an end, and all the Poor kept from want (their being ſufficient within the King's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to do it) that what is ſpent in Vanity might be forborn, and what is waſted in Oppreſſion might be withheld, and other wayes found out (as ſomething hath been preſcribed by <hi>Thomas Lawrence</hi> of <hi>Marleborough</hi>) until there were not one poor Member of all the Body of the King's Dominions to be found, that had need to ask for Food or Rayment, by reaſon of the Brotherly Care, Love and Unity in the aforeſaid Subjects.</p>

               <p>VVEre many of the King's Subjects the true Servants and Children of the inviſible God of Heaven and Earth, by true mortification, ſanctification and regeneration, and truly led, moved and guided by the Spirit of God, and many of them ſo grown into the Power and Wiſdom of God really, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſo having the Spirit of the Lord poured ſorth upon them in theſe latter dayes, according to the promiſe of God, which muſt be and is already fulfilled, ſo that at a needful time one of them having (as it was ſaid of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch. 5. v. 11.) the <hi>Spirit, Light, Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> being found in him, could ſhew unto the King ſuch a thing or things, or ſecret Determination of God, which all others (the King's Wiſe-men) whomſoever could not; and to diſcover the lurking of the King's Enemies unto him, and their ſecret purpoſes againſt him, though they were far remote; as <hi>Eliſha</hi> diſcovered unto the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that which the King of <hi>Syria</hi> in his Bed-chamber contrived againſt him, whereby the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> eſcaped his Plots, not once or twice, 2 <hi>King</hi> 6. 10. And that they could and did at any time, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times (as moved of the Lord) declare and ſhew unto the King, the Counſel of God concering himſelf and his Kingdom, and what would come to paſs concerning both; and how he might avoid the <hi>Evil,</hi> and chuſe the <hi>Good,</hi> like as <hi>Samuel</hi> and other Prophets, who had the Spirit, were wont to do unto the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the dayes of old, that ſo his Throne might be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs; which would be more than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66375:140"/> Honour for the King; and God might bleſs and proſper him for their ſakes, as he did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for the ſake of that one faithful man <hi>Joſeph,</hi> after the King had releaſed him out of Bonds.</p>
               <p>But by this time many might ſay unto me, as a Lord ſaid unto the Prophet, when he ſpake of things much unlike to come to paſs, <hi>How can theſe things be, though God ſhould make Windows in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, That though I do not affirm, that all thoſe things ſhall come to paſs concerning him; yet I ſay, that many are already, and many more may come to the ſlate aſoreſaid; And it would be his Happineſs, and more for his Honour than men can yet receive, to be chief Magiſtrate among or over ſuch a People, and to have moſt of his Subjects ſo qualified, and great would be his Peace thereby.</p>
               <p>And thus further I ſay, That the God of Heaven and Earth hath promiſed, <hi>That a People ſhall be all Righteous,</hi> and that <hi>Iniquity ſhall ceaſe,</hi> and <hi>the Nations ſhall learn War no more, but every one ſhall reſt under his own Vine, and, and none ſhall make them afraid; and they ſhall be in League with the Stones of the Field; and the Beaſts of the Field ſhall be at peace with them.</hi> And the Lord God hath brought many into the entrance of theſe things, that with Chriſt in the Prophet they can <hi>give their Backs to the Smiter, and their Cheeks to him that plucketh off the Hair.</hi> And if it were well if that all the King's Subjects were come to the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and to live in that upright ſtate; then it is not ill that ſome are come unto that ſtate already: And if the <hi>little</hi> that is begun towards this work were cheriſhed, might it not grow and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe towards that ſtate hinted at in the former brief Particulars, touching the Honour of the King, though there is an Honour which exceeds all this?</p>
               <p>And certainly the Word of the Lord will ſtand forever, though Men and their Powers, and Heaven and Earth may paſs away: And aſſuredly the God of Righteouſneſs hath begun his Work in this Nation, and in the hearts of many of his little Ones; And <hi>a Little One</hi> (he hath ſaid) <hi>ſhall become a Thouſand, and a ſmall One, a ſtrong Nation;</hi> and <hi>the Kingdoms of this World ſhall become the Kingdom of our God, and of his Chriſt.</hi> And what if a Nation
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66375:141"/> be born at once, and <hi>Sion</hi> bring forth before her Travel, and the Lord anſwer before his People call, and hear while they are yet ſpeaking, and multiply the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as the Stars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and encreaſe the innocent flock of his Fold as the innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Plants upon the face of the Earth, that Sin and Iniquity may have an end, and Righteouſneſs reign for evermore.</p>
               <p>And if it be farther enquired, <hi>How the King might have his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects truly principled and qualified as afore ſaid;</hi> or, <hi>have ſuch Subjects generally thus for his great Honour?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer</hi> further (to the everlaſting Praiſe of God) That there are many (which may well be called ſome of his trueſt Subjects in his Dominions) that are already truly principled and qualified, as aforeſaid; and more are entering and growing up into the ſame Faithfulneſs, Love, Unity and Peace with all men, and God will encreaſe them; and it might be much for the Honour of (God and) the King to encourage them therein; and much for the diſhonour of God, and diſhonour and great diſadvantage of the King divers ways, if he ſeek, or ſhould be perſwaded to ſeek the hindrance of theſe things, or of his Subjects, who are thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready qualified, or the encreaſe of their Number therein, or their encreaſing in the honeſt, noble, honourable upright things aforeſaid; which things might make for the <hi>Honour of the King,</hi> and will certainly be for the <hi>Glory of God.</hi>

            <p>For dear <hi>Friends,</hi> the Father is well-pleaſed in him who is <hi>meek and lowly in the Heart,</hi> and in obedience unto him through the leadings of his Spirit of Power in which the Father's Love is manifeſt, which leadeth in the low Ground, where the ſafe way of everlaſting Peace is known, where all things are quiet and ſtill, where the ſmall ſtill Voice is heard, whereby the Dead come to live in the powerfull Life of the Fathers Love, which compaſſeth about the Seed as a Wall of everlaſting Strength, which is made perfect in Weakneſs, and to the Weak is only to be known, that the Weak then may ſay, <hi>I am ſtrong,</hi> feeling Strength miniſtered forth from that which is begotten of the Father, which never was comprehended by the Earthly Wiſdom, which is all ſcattered as the Smoke before the Wind, when he ariſeth, who hath long been as a Servant, and is now to be ſerved, that he may be Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, who is as a Man of Sorrows, and leadeth through the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſtate, that by the Obedience of Faith, through the Power of the Croſs, which crucifies and brings to the Death that which is to dye, that the Vail may be rent, the way into the Holieſt of all made manifeſt, and that received into the new Ground which abideth forever, <hi>even that which now Comforteth the weary Soul, and Satisfieth the longing Spirit, and Repleniſheth the dry and barren Land with the Rivers of the Valley, and the Springs of the Deſart, that the Meek in the Earth may Rejoyce forever, and through the Earth may grow as a Lilly in Summer:</hi> For plainly, its the Poor that receive the Goſpel, and the Meek of the Earth that ſhall inherit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and its the Lowly that will abide forever, and the Seed

                  <p>
                     <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether all or as many of you, whom the King hath placed in Authority to do his his will, and act according to his Proclamations, and miniſter Juſtice (<hi>not Cruelty</hi>) according to his Laws, for the puniſhment of Evil, and inſtead thereof (as towards us) act otherwiſe, and that alſo in his Name; do you not therein diſhonour the King?</p>
                  <p>Q. 2. Whether this which the King hath promiſed, declar'd, and ſo often ſtood to confirm (as aforeſaid) both in general, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66375:145"/> us in particular, (to wit) <hi>Liberty of Conſceince,</hi> be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or unreaſonable? If you hold it unreaſonable, do you not diſhonour the King, and his Council both? The King, in that he did ſo, and his Council in that they adviſed Him no better all that time? But if the thing be Reaſonable, you ſit in place by the King to ſee it done, it being part of your ſervice to him; Then whether you do not more diſhonour the <hi>King</hi> therein, (and neglect your Duty and deny Reaſon) when you act quite contrary, and that in his Name, and ſo make uſe of his Name to diſhonour his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Q. 3. Whether all ſuch that are ſet in Authority under him, who do not ſee to the Performance of this, which the <hi>King</hi> hath ſo much, and ſo often engaged himſelf in, but do cauſe his Word and Promiſe, in that thing to be broken, do not therein much diſhonour the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. 4. Whether all them that counſel the <hi>King</hi> not to keep his Promiſe in this thing, or ſubtilly perſwade him unto ſuch things, whereby at laſt his Word and Promiſe herein muſt needs be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, do not therein endeavour to lead him in that unſound path of <hi>Oliver,</hi> and them Rulers who broke Word and Promiſe with God and men, and ſo cauſe the <hi>King</hi> to loſe part of the love of many of his Subjects by breaking his word like them?</p>
                  <p>Q. 5. Whether this which the <hi>King</hi> hath ſo freely Offered, ſo fully Engaged, ſo firmly Promiſed, ſo often Renewed, ſo far Confirmed and ſo largely Publiſhed (it being a thing of ſo much concernment, for preſerving peace in his Kingdoms) is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be performed, and by the <hi>King,</hi> and all other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Juſtice, and all Officers whatſoever at all times to be granted, and in all places, and in all Courts, unto all Perſons tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned therein? And whether they all ought not to have a ſpecial care, that his Subjects be not deprived of the benefit of this thing, which from the <hi>King</hi> to them is made ſo ſtrong as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid?</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Kings</hi> words were true (as indeed they were) which he lately ſpoke in the Houſe, as aforeſaid, <hi>That the breach of his Word or Promiſe, can never be a good ingredient to his future Security:</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66375:146"/> thoſe be good Subjects to him therein, who ſeek to have it done? And what good ſecurity can ever come to Him thereby? and whether many do not endeavour very much to have his Promiſe broken, and ſometimes already do it alſo, though he hath (as it was ſaid) it can never be for good; yet do not many endeavour it, eſpecially to have his Word and Promiſe broken, which was to us, <hi>for the Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> and whether all thoſe do ſeek his good and future ſecurity therein or not; let his Words ſtand either againſt or for them in that matter. And as the King hath ſaid, <hi>That the breach of his Word of Promiſe can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a good Ingredient to his future ſecurity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. 7. Then whether the breach of this ſo often an engaged Promiſe, of ſo high a concernment (<hi>for Liberty</hi>) may not cauſe the People much to queſtion in themſelves, or in their minds, whether he may not be drawn aſide from the performance of the reſt of his Promiſes, pertaining to other matters, and ſo cauſe them to be afraid leſt he will forget his other Promiſes alſo; and ſo prove unfaithful to his Word, like them before, ſeeing the People have long and often been deceived with fair Speeches and Pretences, by many Rulers, one after another this long time, who did not perform what they promiſed to them?</p>

And ſhould the King be perſwaded moreover to break his Promiſe, and reſtrain Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo thereby ruinate many Families, impoveriſh many that now live well, honeſt and comfortable, and cauſe Children to ſtarve in the Streets, and Old People to periſh with Hardſhips and Abuſes, and many more to loſe their Lives in Priſons, as ſome have done already, (who can lay down their Lives for Chriſts ſake) and that not for any Evil in the leaſt done or intended by the ſaid Sufferers, but only truly and purely in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God, and whether this would not be unmerciful?</p>
                     <p>The third <hi>Query</hi> upon the ſame.</p>
                     <p>ANd is it not ſaid in ſome of that part of the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> which is (in it) appointed to be read once a Year, or upon that day called <hi>Aſhwedneſday, Curſed are the unmerciful;</hi> and ſhould any man be firſt perſwaded to be unmerciful, and ſo brought liable to the Curſe, and then they themſelves to curſe him (once a Year) who cauſe him to be unmerciful, and it may be much endeavour to make he himſelf ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to the Curſe againſt himſelf, and ſo curſe one another? And is it not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for any man to come under the Curſe, and to be unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, leſt God ſhut up his Mercy from him? Therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercy and Pity doth not become the King, that therewith his Throne might be upheld? And whether all the wiſe men he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66375:149"/> hath, with all his Biſhops and his armed men, with all ſtrength and Wiſdom elſe whatſoever be able to uphold his Throne without Gods Mercy; and if he would alwayes receive Mercy from God to have his Throne alwayes upheld thereby? Whether it be not meet, if not needful, for him alwayes to ſhew mercy, and to let all people, but eſpecially <hi>Gods Servants,</hi> have Mercy from him, or at leaſt ſo much right, as the Lord himſelf hath given them, which is, to Worſhip him in Spirit, and ſerve him in that which <hi>purgeth the Conſcience from dead works, that they may ſerve the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, Heb.</hi> 9. 14. And ſeeing the King hath promiſed, as aforeſaid, that ſuch ſhall not be diſquieted therein, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe lines are not written for his good, and in love unto the King?</p>
                     <p>3. And ſeeing the ſame that ſaid, <hi>I am the Truth, (who was in the beginning with God,</hi> Prov. 8. 30.) ſaid likewiſe, <hi>By me Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Juſtice,</hi> Prov. 8. 15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Then whether he be not the Power of God, who ſaid ſo? And if ſo that he be the Power of God, and that thereby Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces decree Juſtice (or that which is juſt) then what Power is that by which Princes decree Injuſtice? And whether it be not Injuſtice for the King (to be perſwaded) to break his Word and Promiſe; and which Power are thoſe men in that would have him do ſo, ſeeing Chriſt is the Power of God, by whom Juſtice is decreed? And is it not juſt for the King to be as good as his word, and may not all ſuch as would have him break his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, remember, <hi>That Lying Lips become not a Prince, Prov.</hi> 17. 7.</p>
                     <p>Moreover according to reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Whether many of them that do ſo much endeavour to have the <hi>King</hi> act contrary to his word, or make void his promiſe, by reſtraining ſober honeſt Perſons from the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in ſpiritual matters, and duties of prayer to the God of Heaven, and waiting upon the Lord in his true ſervice, and fear of his holy Name; whether ſuch as theſe would be contented themſelves to be reſtrained from the Wicked Liberty of their fleſhly Luſts (though that was never ſo openly promiſed them) and ſo to be kept from all <hi>Whoredom, Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> and ſuch other works of Darkneſs, wherewith they ſerve the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? And can ſuch be willing that all <hi>Boyes,</hi> and all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:66375:150"/> as often as they ſee a <hi>Whoremonger,</hi> or a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> then all cry out preſently <hi>A Whoremonger, A Whoremonger,</hi> or, <hi>A Drunkard, A Drunkard,</hi> as they are, that ſuch ſhould cry after us, <hi>A Quaker, A Quaker?</hi> And whether ſuch be willing to ſuner as much for their prophane Swearing as they would us (and as we have done) for not Swearing at all? And whether ſuch can be content to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as great Puniſhment for going to an <hi>Ale-Houſe</hi> (needleſly) on the <hi>Firſt-Dayes</hi> (or any day) as they would have us ſuffer for not going to the Steeple-houſe the <hi>Firſt-dayes?</hi> (which to us is needleſs) And whether they would have ſuch Laws made againſt them, for ſuch things, and ſuch their practices, as they would have made againſt us, for our practices, in <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> as pertaining to the ſervice and Worſhip of God? And if Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty had been ſo much promiſed them, in this their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as hath been to us in the matter of Conſcience; would they have had that promiſe broken? And whether they would be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of their <hi>Ale-houſes, Tipling-houſes</hi> and <hi>Whore-houſes,</hi> as oft as they meet there, or could be found there by any Officer, Souldiers, Boyes or People, as they would have other ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haled out of their <hi>own Houſes</hi> and <hi>peaceable, private</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Meeting-houſes,</hi> wherein they meet to <hi>ſerve God?</hi> And would they receive every ſuch time the like uſage or abuſes by any Boyes or Perſons that ſhould find them there, or take them in ſuch things, and that would ſtone them for their <hi>Whoredom</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> at the preſent? or would they receive the like Puniſhment after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they were brought before a Magiſtrate in Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or otherwiſe? If not, then whether all ſuch men as theſe (who would have the King break <hi>his Word</hi>) be not abſolutely of the <hi>Devil?</hi> And would they not limit the Spirit of God, and his Worſhip and Servants, and tolerate the Spirit of the Devil, and have liberty for his ſervice and his Children therein? And then, whether it be good or ſafe at all for the King to hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Counſel of ſuch men, or in the leaſt to incline thereunto in this matter? And whether the Lord God will ever bleſs their Counſels herein (which lead to Deſtruction?) And whether the King be in the leaſt to receive or conſent to the Counſel of ſuch men herein, or their Petitions in that matter, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Breaker of his Word</hi> and <hi>Promiſe?</hi> This will I leave to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66375:150"/> Gods witneſs in themſelves, and in the <hi>King, Council, Parliament,</hi> and all other <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and other inferiour Officers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatſoever to anſwer, yea or nay.</p>
                     <p>And further, I might enquire in like manner, concerning the matter and manner or form and place of Worſhip, whether they would be deprived of theirs, as they would have us of ours, and be haled out as they have haled us, and ſuffer ſo much therein as they have cauſed us, and have Laws made againſt them for it, as they have made againſt us, and have another manner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Place, and Teachers impoſed upon them, than what they are perſwaded of to be Right? And how do ſuch come to be more certain that their way of Worſhip is right in things they have no Scripture, nor example therein for, than we do come to be certain that our way is right, which we have Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and example therein for? And how came they to know that their worſhip is better in a temple made with hands, in which God dwelleth not, and the Apoſtle declared againſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 44. than ours is <hi>in the Spirit</hi> (of which God is, <hi>John</hi> 4. 24.) and in the Truth, which is his Son, <hi>in whom the fulneſs of God doth dwell,</hi> Col. 2. 9. <hi>and in the Light,</hi> where God doth dwell; for Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am the Light</hi> John 8. 12. <hi>And he that hath Immortallity dwelleth in the Light,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 16? And whether ſuch as are compelled to a Worſhip, which they are perſwaded is not right, and that God doth not accept, are they not therein made Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites?

               <p>XIV. Whether thoſe that in this life have put on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Light, are not to let it ſhine before men, that God may be glorified? And whether it be not for God's glory, when his people are by the Light defended from all the works of darkneſs?

               <p>If they do not, then whether therein they are not juſt like the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> of Old, who laid heavy Burdens upon the People, but themſelves would not move them with one of their Fingers?</p>
               <p>XVII. Again, if any men in Youth, Infancy or full Age, do attain ſo far in their own particulars, to forſake all tho things aforeſaid, (which indeed includes all Sin) whether they can ſafely, and with a good Conſcience, Promiſe and Vow for another, that he ſhall do the like, ſeeing alſo it is but an Infant?

               <p>If they do, let God's Witneſs in their Conſciences anſwer, which will ſhew the truth of the matter.</p>

               <p>If Good, why are many this day Perſecuted and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for ſo doing?</p>
               <p>XIX. Whether the <hi>old Man</hi> in People or Children may be<note place="margin">See further in publick Baptiſm.</note> ſo buried, that the <hi>new Man</hi> may be raiſed up in them?</p>
               <p>If not, why have the Prieſts prayed ſo many Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</p>

               <p>XX. Again, if the <hi>new Man</hi> be to be raiſed up in People when they are in Infancy; then whether it be not to be raiſed up any other time, or ſome other time of their Life, if it be not raiſed up in their Infancy? And then whether they be not true Labourers who labour to raiſe this up in People? And whether they be not effectual Preachers who do thereby raiſe it up in People? And whether this <hi>new Man</hi> be not Chriſt? And if he be not raiſed up, whether the Preaching be not vain, the Faith vain, and the People continue in their Sins, that being not raiſed up in them, which is to ſave from Sin? And whether this <hi>new Man</hi> is not in People and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before it be raiſed up? And is not the <hi>new Man</hi> the <hi>ſecond Adam?</hi> And is not that the <hi>Seed,</hi> which if we had been left without, we had been as <hi>Sodom?</hi> And is not the Seed

And was not the firſt man made of the Earth? and are not all People deſcended from him, and ſo of the Earth? And whether it be not unreaſonable that many Hundreds ſhould be Perſecuted chiefly for profeſſing this, and that by ſuch who taught them ſo to profeſs, and for witneſſing, ſpeaking and writing of the new man raiſed up in them, and for living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly according thereunto?</p>
               <p>XXI. Whether Children or People (who have the new man raiſed up in them) may have all carnal Affections dye in them, and come to know all things belonging to the Spirit (not only) to live (but alſo) to grow in them? If not, why are they deceived with thoſe fair Speeches? If they may, then who are moſt agreeable thereunto, and the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they that only talk of, and profeſs theſe things effected inwardly, and yet deny that any live in it; or them that are come unto, and do truly know, and live in the poſſeſſion of theſe things within them?</p>
               <p>XXII. Whether the <hi>New Man</hi> be not the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the quickning Spirit? And if it be, whether as many as are truly led thereby (it being within them) be not the Sons or Children of God?

Whether all the Children theſe late hundred Years that were baptized, were regenerated when a little Water was ſprinkled upon their faces, though it were done by ſuch a Prieſt who himſelf was Unregenerate, and either a Proud, Covetous or Drunken Man? If they were, or the moſt part of them, how then did they come afterwards to be Unregenerate, ſeeing that after their <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> moſt are looked upon to be, and by their Fruits do indeed appear in an Unregenerate eſtate? And whether in any Age it can be

Was all this done for them, and did they truly come from the one ſtate into the other, by having a little Water poured on their faces, and by the ſpeaking of theſe words, viz. <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Amen?

If they were made ſo, how ſhall a reaſonable man be perſwaded from any good reaſon of Scripture-proof, that they are afterwards diſmembred from Chriſt, ſeparated from God, and diſ-inherited out of the Kingdom of Heaven?

               <p>XXVI. How can ſuch make others the Members of Chriſt, who are not ſo themſelves? And whether Chriſt hath any miſerable Members?

               <p>XXVIII. Whether Children were not firſt taught their duty towards God, before their duty towards their Neighbour? And whether all ſuch are not ſtill in the firſt place to obey God, and ſecondly, to love their Neighbour as themſelves? And ſo, whether Obedience to God is not ſtill to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obedience to man, though his Neighbour? If not, why were they ſo taught?

               <p>XXIX. Whether Children are not taught (among other things) to hurt no body by word or deed, to bear no Malice in the heart, to rule the Hands, the Tongue, the Body and the Deſire, in not coveting any man's Goods? If this be right ſo to do, why do not the Prieſts themſelves do it, and inſtruct all Magiſtrates and People in the like, and ſuffer them that do ſo, and encourage them alſo to continue in the ſame? If this be not right, why did the Prieſts teach it us when we were young? and whether be the Prieſts covetous, yea or nay?</p>

Whether Children were not taught, that they could do little of themſelves, nor walk in the Commandments of God, nor ſerve him without his ſpecial Grace; and after in another place, that the Geace was inward and Spiritual?

               <p>XXXI. Again, if none can walk in the Commands of God, nor ſerve him without his ſpecial Grace, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; then what manner of walking or ſervice is theirs, who of late have denyed the Grace which is inward, and them that are led by it; which Grace the Biſhop in the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

And if ſo, then whether that man which is cauſed to worſhip ſuch a woman, or a woman in ſuch a ſtate, do not therein worſhip one that was deceived by the Devil?</p>
               <p>XXXVI. But whether doth the man worſhip the woman, yea or nay? If he doth, is it not evil to worſhip the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any thing elſe but God alone?

            <p>And then the Mind being from the Light, a hardneſs comes in, and the Rebellious take entrance; and ſo that which is worſe than before gets ſtrength, which being joyned unto, leads in a ſecret deformity, farther from the Witneſs then ever; ſo that then the good Savour comes to be loſt, and the Underſtanding darkned, not knowing the true motion, and often a carcleſs Spirit gets head, and ſuch are from the true Love and ſuffering Seed in themſelves, and ſo not joyned in the <hi>Covenant of Love and Peace,</hi> with them that abide therein, the which they ſceing, a diſcontent ariſeth therein in the mind; ſo did <hi>Cain,</hi> he murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the other, but the Fault was in himſelf, for Sin lay at the Door; and it is Sin to tranſgreſs againſt that which is Perfect; and the Light is the perfect gift of God, and his Gifts are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and in the Light there is no Evil, and the Light is to lead out of that which is Imperfect, &amp; they that err from the Light are in the ſtrife and fleſhly will: And the other Eye ſeeks for evil, and then that kindles a Fire in the Bowels, and eats as a Worm, and

            <p>Let the Light ariſe in you, my dear Ones, that with it your Hearts may be opened one to another, that you may know that the Lord is a God of Power, and near at hand unto the Humble, that in his Love you may be kept, and by his Power be defended, and ſo from ſtrength to ſtrength in his fear to walk, and to come at laſt to be a People <hi>ſaved from Death,</hi> and <hi>redeemed from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Fleſh.</hi>

               <p>And that is a Temptation that leadeth man to commit any manner of ſin whatſoever, and keeps man from believing in him that maketh an end of Sin, and keeps man in ſin, and from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and turning from ſin (whilſt that of God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſtriving with him againſt ſin) perſwading him, that he cannot be free from ſin, and to put off the time of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance until Gods Spirit by the Light in the Heart, hath ceaſed ſtriving, and then ſuch think all is well, becauſe that which judged and condemned them for the leaſt appearance of Evil, hath ceaſed ſtriving with them, that ſo they are now quiet, and not judged as formerly for what they do, though they do the ſame things for which formerly they were judged; but let ſuch aſſuredly know, That that which was ſin, is ſin ſtill, though they (inſtead of coming through the Law) are gone back from the Law which did diſcover it, and come to that ſtate again, which was before the <hi>Law</hi> (or a worſe) where Death reigns, and Sin is in the World, though not diſcovered by the <hi>Law</hi> to them who have deſpiſed the <hi>Law,</hi> and ſo become dead to that which ſhould fulfill the <hi>Law,</hi> and alſo dead in that which doth tranſgreſs the <hi>Law,</hi> even ſo dead in ſin, that now feeling the weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof, neither yet feeling any thing of God in them,

And are not ſuch as theſe, who have got a Profeſſion, more hardned in their Sin, and pleading more ſtrongly for their continuance therein, than the Publicans, Harlots and Prophane?</p>
               <p>And that is a Temptation which draws forth the mind to fear, love, ſerve, obey or reſpect any man, or created thing, glory, honour, or whatſoever may be named, more than God, or to deny obedience to God; for the attaining or retaining thereof, or to let any of the moſt glorious Creatures of God fill and take plnce in the heart, that in it room may not be found for the Power of God to enter; ſo that the life, virtue and ſubſtance of all things, in which there is full ſatisfaction, cannot be received.</p>
               <p>And that is a Temptation that leadeth forth to ſeek or love the praiſe of men; for if that was out of the Faith, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Honour from men, then that muſt needs be of the Devil which would compel Honour to be given to it; that is it in man of the Devil, which would have the begotten of God, honour and worſhip it, which would take the due honour and praiſe from God, to whom alone belongeth all Dominion, Glory, Honour and Obedience, and Praiſes forever and ever.</p>
               <p>And that is a Temptation which draweth forth the Mind to worſhip any other God but he that made all Men of one Blood, and is above all, and through all, and in you all, who dwelleth in his People, and what of him may be known, is manifeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whom all may feel after and find, whom the World by Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth not know; who abhorreth the Sacrifices of them whoſe Hearts are Uncircumciſed; and is wearied with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 17. and grieved with their Iniquity, who heareth not the Prayers of men of Sin, but waiteth to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto ſuch who wait for him in the Light of his Son, who was led as a Lamb dumb, and is of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> who was dumb with ſilence, and opened not his Mouth while the Wicked was in place.</p>
               <p>But when the wicked thing is removed out of his place, and the humble Seed of the Shepherd raiſed up in his Throne upon his Hill of Holineſs, having his Enemies under his Feet, then he ſpeaketh with Authority, and not as the Scribes.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:66375:172"/>
               <p>Thus man coming into the fear of the Lord, and waiting in the Light of his Son in the Heart, with it may he ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between that which diſcovereth and condemneth Sin, and that which tempteth to Sin, out of which that man may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed (and kept out of Temptations) is this written in love to the Seed, over which the Beaſt, the Dog and the Swine do vaunt themſelves, who have nothing to do with this, but only to receive the Cup of Aſtoniſhment, which to the Serpents is to be poured forth, who are not to feed upon this which is written.</p>

               <head>A Direction in the way to that within the Vail, by which <hi>Temptations</hi> are overcome.</head>
               <p>TRuth is that in which the Power of God doth ſtand, and in the Truth there is no Lye; and all them who receive Truth from God, in it they receive his power, whereby they are made his Sons, in his power to ſtand in obedience to his will, which is that by which they are ſanctified, and by obedience of Faith thereunto are preſerved, keeping in ſtedfaſtneſs by the mighty Power of God, out of that which doth defile, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in that Dominion and place of Holineſs, into which the Harlots (out of the Truth and Power) and all proud Boaſters (and ſuch who are intruding into things they have not ſeen, and all Murmurers, who complain for want of Power) do not enter.</p>
               <p>Therefore, all People who profeſs the knowledge of the Truth, and yet have not received the Power of God, in which no Sin doth ſtand, wait ye all in the Light to know the Vail rent, and the ground to be removed, from whence the Words come, which darkens that in which the counſel of God ſhould be received, and wait to feel Judgment and Condemnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earthly, that over the Seed doth rule; and keep Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that through the Condemnation that may ſpring, which never yet was found: For certainly till there be a coming through the Miniſtration of Condemnation, the Pearl is hid under the Earth, and the Earthly bears rule over it, whereby it ſtill in Bondage lies, and the Creature ſometimes led by a fight of that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66375:173"/> which it doth not poſſeſs, holding the Truth of God in that which is not his Righteouſneſs; for his Righteouſneſs is revealed by Faith through the power of him that takes away the Sin; and ſo its not comprehended in, by that mind which is out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And this know aſſuredly, That many may ſee that which is afar off, and not feel the Life of what they ſee; and ſo are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny high Profeſſors in the World, who change from one Opinion to another, and are all yet but fruitleſs Trees, which are to be cut down and rooted up.</p>
               <p>And many there are who call him that is the Light, <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> but to the Light are not obedient in Self-denial, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the daily Croſs, which is the Power of God, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies unto the World; and ſo the firſt Man of the World being not crucified nor put off, the new Man is not received; and ſo little more is witneſſed by many, who profeſs Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Life, than was in the time of other Forms: for if the Death be not known, the Reſurrection of the Juſt received, and the Dead raiſed, then is all in vain: And this is not known by any but ſuch who know the Judgments of the Lord ſet up in the Heart, and the Cup of Aſtoniſhment to the Adulterous Seed, which comes of the will of the Fleſh, and cannot lay down the Life for the Friend.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (I ſay) wait to know the Birth that is Immortal, and feel that born up which never yet was raiſed in them, over whom the Vail yet is, that the free Birth may be known, and the Seed, whom God hath appointed the bleſſing unto, from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der death redeemed, that by the powerful riſings thereof, the underſtanding may be opened with that which was before Forms were, that to it you may come, which giveth Life unto the Soul, and know a Saviour born of the barren Womb, and a Deliverer brought forth in the place where he hath not been known, and the Plant to ſpring out of that ground which is yet dry, that it may be overſhadowed with the lovelineſs of its ſpreading forth, that a way may be opened in the Wilderneſs, and the humble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in the Valley, and ſo come to learn of that which is yet little and low; and take heed of taking counſel of the Serpent, whoſe ſubtilty will ſoon lead forth from the Simplicity, neither cover your ſelves with any thing before the Righteouſneſs of God
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66375:173"/> (which is perfect) be received; but love that which comes from the man of Sorrows, who comes to break the peace of all them who walk not in the Everlaſting Way of Life. Let all them who are out of it, ſearch their Hearts with the Light.</p>
               <p>And take heed of that which is high, froward or ſtrong in the Will [for we are weak] which is not brought to the Croſs; for there is the firſt Birth from the wrong grounds, which will ſpeak and act that which it lives not in, neither is able to confirm it in Faithfulneſs to the Death and Loſs of all; for things may be true in themſelves, and that which is out of the Truth may ſpeak of it; yet ſuch vain Talkers cannot ſuffer to Death for what they ſpeak.</p>
               <p>For that which cometh forth firſt, is ſtrong in the Earthly, and would live forever, and have the Bleſſing, and would rule over the meek thing in the particular; and in others, having a ſecret deſire to be admired, being far unwilling to take a Servants place; but certainly it is the meek, humble, ſuffering Seed (which in many is yet oppreſs'd) that is to laſt forever, who through Death comes into the Dominion.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſink down out of the airy Comprehenſion and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, above the Life, and firſt come to ſuffer with that which is meek and low, if ever you intend with it to reign in that Peace and Life, which from all that without the Vail is hid; and in ſilence watch, and be ſober, to ſee him come which ſaves the Soul, and clothes it with his own Righteouſneſs, that you be not found without a Covering of the Spirit, Power and Life, among the fooliſh Virgins; <hi>for few there be that find the Way of Life, and abide therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I knowing the Terror of the Lord that will certainly come upon all them who dye out of his Covenant, therefore I Warn all People every where (as the Lord enlargeth me) to wait to feel the <hi>powerful Word of Repentance,</hi> and with the Light to make diligent ſearch into the ground and foundation of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Words and Actions.</p>
               <p>For the Lord will make inquiſition for the Blood of the Juſt, and reward the Double-minded according to the intents of their hearts, the Gaul whereof will be rent with the Power of his Might, which will ſweep away the refuge of Lyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,

               <p>To it now therefore bow and bend, for plainly the Lord God, who is Light, will not alwayes ſtrive by the Light of his Son in your hearts: And this know, That as I tender the leaſt honeſt deſires that are begotten in any after the living Truth of God, yet I am to deal plainly with all, and clear my Conſcience of all who are covered with their own Conceivings, and in Words and Writing to warn all in the Spirit of Truth and Meekneſs, as the Lord moveth me in faithfulneſs to declare againſt that which yet in any bears rule over the Seed, which by Judgment muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned, and all the Judgments of the Lord are true.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ye that are willing to come out of <hi>Temptations,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that where the fooliſh Virgins cannot enter, wait in the fear of the Lord to feel his Work within, whilſt the day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>And then did the Lord in the Bowels of his Mercy let open his Ear, and for his own Names-ſake had regard unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the poor and needy, and he cauſed Light to break out of Darkneſs, and Truth to ſpring from its ſecret hidden place,

O! it even melts the heart to remember the dayes that are paſt, and to conſider the infinite Goodneſs of him that is the God of the Poor and Needy! Then were many made willing to run and to leave their filthy Garments behind them, even before they well knew how to do it: O! how loathſom was Sin in that day? and how weariſom was the Land of Darkneſs? and how deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, even beyond expreſſion was the unſatisfied thirſting Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Preſence of God? Could the Treaſure of the Earth then have given Peace? or, could Silver have ſatisfied the hungry heart? Or, could the choiſeſt Love of the moſt neareſt Relations have quenched the thirſt of the parched ground? Surely none but the Lord was then deſired; yea, other Lovers became as loathſom, and other Delights became burthenſom to the weary Travellers, and all Vanities began to vaniſh as a Vapour of Smoke, and the Wind of Heaven was daily a ſcattering the chaff, and the barren Womb mourned for the quickning Life of God, who had put it into the hearts of his long afflicted ſcattered Ones, to follow him in the Ways of Truth &amp; Equity; and then did the Lord viſit ſuch again and again in his Loving-kindneſs, by his Servants, whoſe Living Words of Truth, through them, did yet more open the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings &amp; Hearts, &amp; ſatisfie the judgments of the humble Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the knowledge of the way to Reſt and Peace, in leaving the <hi>evil</hi> &amp; chuſing the <hi>good,</hi> &amp; to walk &amp; come to live therein forever.</p>
               <p>And then came the time of Trial and Exerciſe, when the Croſs muſt be taken up to the Worlds wayes, and all fooliſh Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66375:181"/> left behind, and the needleſs words no longer uſed, nor that Religion continued any longer in, which made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Then did the People gaze and wonder, and the Relations and the Acquaintance ſtood like as from <hi>David</hi> afar off; and then was every ones greateſt Enemy (with the Light) found in his own Houſe; then did the Tribes of the Earth mourn; then did the Dragon ſtretch forth his Power; then did the Doubtings, and Fears, and Thoughts, and Unbelief come roling in like Floods; O the ſtraights that many then were in, even ſeeming greater than any before, and none but the Lord could deliver, ſo that then the Cryes were doubled, and the ſecret Groans came on afreſh again, and the greater the Cryes of ſuch were, the more they prevailed with him that was to help, but with his Rod he forced them to ſubmit unto his Will, by departing out of that which had cauſed him to frown upon them, and by leaving that which had polluted their Dwelling, and as they began to obey him therein, ſo he began to let forth the ſmiles of his Favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and when they offended again, he chaſtized them fore, and ſcourged them for their Negligence, and corrected them becauſe they forgot their Obedience to his will; and as thereby they drew near unto him, he eaſed the ſtroke of his Juſtice, and let them taſte of his Mercy, and ſometimes invited them with love, as a Father draweth the Child. And thus he left not working with them, and in them by his own ſecret Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, until he had brought them to be after the deſire of his Heart, that he might delight in them forever, and that they might never more be ſcattered upon the barren Hills, nor yet the dark Mountains.</p>
               <p>And as Obedience, in Truth and Innocency, was willingly yeilded to the Lord, Peace began to take hold, and Satisfaction got ſome entrance, and a little ſecret hope there was, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as an Anchor to the Soul, againſt the Stormy time, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the midſt thereof; and as Inniquity was departed from, ſo there came into the humble Heart ſome ſatisfaction from God, and ſome ſtability in his way of Righteouſneſs, and then refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Life attended the heart in the Morning, and the Water which reneweth the Thirſty, began to open it ſelf in the midſt of a barren Land; and then nothing was more deſired than the

And ſo, he ſet before them the way in which they ſhould walk with him, wherein he would be their Father, and the Rock of their ſtrength, and made known unto them the ſecret Myſteries of his heavenly bleſſed Will, which had been long concealed, and doth yet ſo remain from the Diſobedient, and covered from the Children of men.</p>

               <p>ANd Friends, this is a time of quietneſs and ſtillneſs, or a time for you ſo to be, and there hath been a large time of gathering, and for convincing; and now the Lord is proving
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66375:183"/> and trying them that are gathered; And after this time, bleſſed and thrice happy ſhall they be, that are found faithful in it, and worthy to be Crowned with Heavenly Honour, and to be further employed in Gods ſervice, and to remain as Pillars among the Flock of Heaven, and as Lights to invite others home to the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God. And, now ſhould all Friends be kept in Wiſdom, and take heed what words they uſe among men, or concerning any men, though they do contrive againſt us: Had the Lord left us where they are, and ſet them where he hath placed us, then might we have been this day as ignorant of the Way of Peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Enemies, and of the Path of Innocency and Righteouſneſs, as they now are, but the Lord hath ſhewed us Mercy; And I ſay, the God of Heaven forgive them and defend us; And all that dwell in this, may come at laſt to ſee a time of greater Gathering, than ever yet was: Oh! my Pen cannot write it.

            <p>Behold, I ſay, unto you, who have perſecuted the Innocent, and ſmote the harmleſs with the Tongue, and the Fiſt of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, if you will let the humble ſeed ariſe in you, and read with fear, and conſider in Meekneſs, with a true deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Power of God's Love, unto you is this Word of Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſent; therefore, O ye men, feel ye that which opens the heart; for behold, I was made of one fleſh with you, and the Lord God, and Father of my Life, made all men of one Blood that they might feel after him and find him; and ſurely, from the true ſence
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66375:189"/> and feeling of Gods infinite Love unto Mankind, that he might be ſaved from Wrath to come; Therefore am I moved, with my Father's Pity, to viſit you, to whom Gods Love is, and in whom the Seed lieth in Bondage, and is not brought to the birth nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, but the Earth is over it; and you that ſhould be gathered into God's Everlaſting Covenant of Peace, who lie yet in the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, why will you not believe my words, which are the Truth of the Lord, in the Power of his Love, which will ſtand forever? And ſo, all your Hating, Reviling and Impriſoning the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and Seed of God without you, in the Nation, and your ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over the Innocent, Honeſt, Plain and Harmleſs, is unto you a true figure of your hating, reſiſting and impriſoning the Seed of God which is in you; and your ruling over the honeſt meek thing in you, with Tyranny and Cruelty in the ſtrength of your wills; and this hath long been ſo, and by this figure, hath the Lord been pleaſed to preach unto you of late years, that you might hear, and ſee, and underſtand; and this is plainly ſo, you being not reconciled unto that of God in Bondage in you, Therefore is your hatred againſt them without you, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, and have no Confidence in the fleſh; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are not reconciled to him that made you, therefore hath his witneſs in you often times diſturbed and broke your Peace in the Earth, and the hand of the Lord hath ſo followed you, that many times you could not cauſe his Spirit to ceaſe ſtriving with you for ſome time, but even trouble from it hath come upon you, even in the Night-ſeaſon, when you would have Peace; and when the Power of the Enemy of your ſouls, hath riſen up in you, with Wrath and Envy, in haſtineſs and paſſion againſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, and thereby have been moved with Envy, to act that which was Evil againſt them, intending thereby to make the true <hi>Jews</hi> bow down unto <hi>Haman</hi>'s ſpirit in you; then afterwards, and ſome at the very time, hath the witneſs of God in you aroſe and brought Judgment, and Trouble, and Torment upon you, when ſome of you have been alone, in quietneſs, then hath the Lord been ſecretly Dealing with you by his meaſure of Light in you, the which you have ſtrove againſt, ſome not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it was, and ſought Peace and eaſe another way, and ſo have not loved that which came to confound your Wiſdom,

And is it not a hard ſaying unto you, that have talkt of God, to preach him unto you, <hi>who confounds the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and brings the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the prudent to nothing?</hi> and to tell you, how <hi>that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in you?</hi> Is it not therefore plain, that you are yet joyned to that which is to be confounded, and ſo have not received that which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, though it be in you; for the Kingdom of God was in the Phariſees, but they not knowing it, did neither know the Lord of Glory, but crucified him without them, and reſiſted that which was holy in them, yet profeſſed the Scriptures without them, as you do, whoſe minds are out from the meaſure of the Inſpiration of that Spirit in you, which gave forth the Scriptures, which are without you, which Scriptures alſo teſtifie of the Light of Chriſt, which is in you, and of that which may be known of God in you, to which you are to come; for unto them who had the Scriptures without them, Chriſt Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Come unto me, I am meek and low in heart;</hi> and his Name is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is nigh, even in your hearts, though from you there it be hid as a Treaſure hid in the Field; but though it be hid from you, yet it is there, and though you have been unprofitable, yet have you had a Talent; yea, the Lord God hath given Gifts to the Rebellious, (though they receive it not) that he might dwell in them; ye hard-hearted, ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed! why will you not believe my words? Why will you not receive the Truth? When will you bend and bow before the Lord God of Life? Can you ſay in your hearts, like the fool, <hi>That there is no God?</hi> Would you ſhut him out, from having an entrance in you? When was it that you did come to this thing which is hid in the heart? And when did you try this thing, which ſometimes judgeth, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, troubleth or confoundeth, whether this thing would give you the knowledge of God? And is not the Light to give the knowledge of God? And doth not he that is the Light enlighten
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66375:190"/> every man? And is not the Light that which doth make manifeſt? And is not there ſomething in you, that doth at ſometimes make manifeſt? And is there not ſomething in you, which doth judge and condemn you for Evil, which is made manifeſt by it? You that talk of <hi>trying all things;</hi> Is not there one thing, and have you not yet need of one thing, even that which gives Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſin, and cleanſeth from all ſin? And have you tryed this one thing, the Light, or that of God in you? Whether this will bring you to Peace with God and man? And whether by this in you, you may overcome the World, which is let in the heart? And was not he that is the Light and the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World? And hath not the World ſuch a Foundation in you, and ſuch a growth and ſtature over you, that you cannot ſee to the end of it, nor believe to the overcoming of it? And is it not therefore, that you are joyned to that by which the Lamb is ſlain, ſo that his Grave is with the Rich, and his Burial with the Wicked; read and underſtand? And doth not the Blood of the ſlain Cry from the ground againſt you? Did you never hear the the oppreſſed Cry? Did you never feel a ſeed in you, cry aloud for Life, though it lies in the Death? Did you never know the houſe of Mourning, nor feel him near, who is a man of Sorrows? Are you quite dead and paſt feeling; Nay nay, there is many of you; are not ſo far hardened, nor yet ſo much given up how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the time hath been that you all might have known this thing I declare, of which belongs to your peace, you that have the Scriptures, and are talking of the place of holy Worſhip, take heed, hearken and hear a little, <hi>He that makes an end of ſin is come near unto you,</hi> he who remains a Prieſt forever, Mourneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, and your day of viſitation is come, yea, behold the Lamb, the meek, harmleſs, unſpotted, beloved of God, comes meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though eſteemed not able to ſave himſelf, yet behold, its the King of Glory crowned with Immortality forever, who rides meekly in Righteouſneſs, and gentle in the Father's Wiſdom; yea, the Heir is come, reſiſt him not, leſt the thing which belongs to your Everlaſting peace be hid from your Eyes, for evermore, and you left deſolate, only having the Scriptures of Truth, but not the Truth in the inward parts, where the knowledge of it makes free.</p>

            <p>DEar and well-beloved Friends, who continue true Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Lamb of God in faithful Sufferings for the Teſtimony of his Name, and remain Priſoners for the ſame Truth and Teſtimony of Jeſus, for which alſo this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of mine doth and hath long ſuffered Reſtraint and Bonds, and my Soul grieved with the <hi>Sodomitiſh Wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Prophainneſs</hi> of Hard-hearted Rebellious to God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Ungodly People, whoſe Judgment ſlumbereth not, and whoſe Damnation will certainly come and be juſt from God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, who have made a Covenant with Death, and ſhew forth themſelves as a people at an Agreement with all the Powers of Hell, in which is the Reward of all the Wicked, that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten God and wholely rejected the manifold Manifeſtation of his Mercies, which unto you, O ye dear and tender-hearted! is as precious Oyl, and as deſirable Treaſure! Who can but prize the Mercies of the God of Heaven? How refreſhingly hath it often flowed in upon the thirſty Habitations of many, to the abundant refreſhing and comforting of the weary Land? Oh! how ſweetly, and with what pleaſantneſs hath mine Eyes beheld the ſpringing up, and the growth and ſpreadings of the tender Plants, after the diſtiling ſtreams of the Heavenly Dews upon them, and every one ſtanding in his place flouriſhing with their Branches over the Earth, not one offending the other, and all caſting forth a ſweet favour, being daily repleniſhed with the ſpringings up of the Sap of Life, and comforted with the Sun Beams of Righteouſneſs? How harmoniouſly then doth the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flouriſh? And how beautiful is every Plant, whom God hath planted? And is it poſſible for any other plants to bring forth Fruits unto holineſs, but only ſuch whom the God of Heaven cauſeth to grow? And how ſad is it for any one Plant to hurt, kill or deſtroy another? And who can without ſome Remorſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66375:192"/> or pity behold the withering and fading of any ſuch Plants, whoſe flouriſhing was once ſo delightſom, that all who paſſed by, and took notice thereof, commended them for their virtue; or at leaſt, took ſome ſpecial notice of their prudence, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of him by whom they flouriſhed, in that they grew, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and proſpered, though they could not perceive, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, by what inviſible virtue they thus were nouriſhed, nor whence it came</p>

How lovely then hath the face of the Righteous been, when Righteouſneſs it ſelf, in the Meekneſs of Love, looked forth at the Windows? How were the Bowels of each other, then enflamed within them? How ſweet was the Beauty of Meekneſs to the Beholders? Who then could but receive the love of the lovelineſs it ſelf?</p>

            <p>The Lord God of Heaven and Earth preſerve my dear ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> out of ſuch things, that a Vail may not come over you, and ſo the Life be ſtopt from ſpringing up in you; for then may ſuch again go Mourning all the day long, when none doth pity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> the often Incomes of Gods Love, and the forth flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſame towards you, and the precious ſeed of God in them parts, hath conſtrained me at preſent to viſit you in the true love of my Soul with theſe Lines, that ſo you might not only

For Behold, the God of Heaven is my Refuge, and ſtrength, and the Lord of Hoſt is my Upholder, and the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is my Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Support, and the daily Incomes of that which doth truly comfort, is as Marrow to my Bones, yea, the Lord hath prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my dayes, inlarged my Borders, and beautifyed the Place of my Dwelling! My heart is overcome with his Love, my Soul is filled with his Virtue, and my Tongue doth declare of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the praiſes of the Lord aſcend up to Heaven, whoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies refreſh the Earth; Oh that you might partake with me of the unſpeakable Bleſſings of God, and feel and receive in your ſelves, the true Tenders and Offers of the tenderneſs of my Love here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preſented unto you, that you might feel your Hearts begin to open therewith, to receive the ſame, that in the Life of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth you may truly perceive me to be preſent praiſing the Lord with you, and likewiſe pertaking with you of your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, having alſo Acquaintance of your Grief, and being truly ſenſible of your manifold Tryals and Tribulations: The Lord preſerve you to the end thereof.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> let not your hearts be ſad, neither be ye over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much caſt down with any thing whatſoever (of which I forbare to mention) neither be ye diſcouraged by reaſon of any thing that the Lord bringeth or ſuffereth to come to paſs, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us or concerning us, neither let the multitude of Tryals, nor the length of dayes therein cauſe you in the leaſt to diſtruſt the Lord, who in his ſecret Wiſdom (in the end of all things) bringeth forth good unto ſuch, who in all conditions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Tryals, do truly love and cleave unto the Lord their ſtrength.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I multiply words? The intent of my heart is, that you might have benefit by the increaſe of the ſame love of God, and the Springings forth thereof, of the which we have all received; For you know the Truth which teacheth all things, and a meaſure of that Life, from whence all theſe words do come, which do ſervice for the Lord, and are helpful to his Servants, and comfortable to his Choſen people and for the refreſhing of the tender Lambs, and the building up of the members in the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66375:193"/> holy Unity, to grow up in the holy Life for the honour of his Glorious Name forever, in whoſe bleſſed <hi>Name, Life, Strength</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> is found, the which indeed is become a true Refuge unto the Choſen <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, where they are ſuccoured, when none can help, and where they are preſerved, when none other can uphold, unto whom they can pour forth their Complaints in ſecret, and Addreſs themſelves at every needful time, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are never by him rejected, nor turned back upon the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearted; as ſometimes it hath been, when help or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort hath been expected from ſome of the Children of men, who may alſo be tempted, and in danger of being overcome, but the Lord can never be overcome, neither can he ever Err in his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or miſtake in his Judgments, nor reject that which is truly ſimple and tender, neither yet receive that which is deceitful, though appearing or ſeeming never ſo Glorious.</p>
            <p>Let all Friends, whoſe hearts are tender, in the tenderneſs thereof ſtill, return unto him, from that which cauſeth a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and out of that which bringeth diſtruſt, to leave that which bringeth darkneſs into the mind, and ſo to get from the barren places into the fruitful Habitation of the living. Then ſhall Peace flow as a River, and Unity ſhall flouriſh as the varieties of the various Flowers in the Field, and Righteouſneſs ſhall ſpread over all as the Morning dew; and then the Beauty of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall ſhine, and the Glory of the Lord ſhall yet more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appear, and fruit ſhall encreaſe as in the Summer ſeaſon, and the Vineyard of the Lord ſhall yet again flouriſh in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and the Lord ſhall be glorified in his Saints, who is greatly admired by all them that truely believe. Oh! that the ſeed might lift up the head! Oh! that the Plants of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might ſpring! that the true Mourner might be comforted, That fruit might abound in abundance, That the weak might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſtrength, That the Seed of the Lamb may know the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lyon, That all might be refreſhed together, and that you all might live, and grow, and encreaſe with the Encreaſes of God.</p>
            <p>The Lord God of Heaven and Earth grant theſe things unto you, and fulfill them in you, that you may be filled with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and wax bold and Valiant to the end, in the noble Life of

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66375:194"/> Call of God in the day of his love hath been unto you: Oh that your Hearts might retain it forever, and that your Eyes might be abundantly opened, to ſee into the unſearchable things of God! Oh, that your underſtandings might yet be more opened to receive the Riches of the inviſible Truth of God! Oh that your Hearts might come to be more enlarged therewith! and that you who have known the Call of God, and felt the working of his Grace in your hearts unto a true Convincement, might all come to <hi>live the Life of Righteouſneſs,</hi> end forever hereafter to walk from that more and more, which you are truly convinced of to be evil, either in Word or Deed, or any manner of Practice whatſoever, and to walk with more Circumſpection, and Integrity, and Faithfulneſs to the Lord, in obedience unto all things, truly made known unto you to be right, and juſtifiable in the ſight of the God of Heaven.

            <p>And the true deſire of my preſent enlarged Heart for your Eternal Happineſs, is, That as the Lord of Heaven and Earth hath counted you worthy of his Call, in the power of his Grace, which bringeth Salvation unto all, you may not judge your ſelves unworthy of the Kingdom of God, but may cleave unto his Truth in the inward parts, leaving all that which hath kept you from it, whatſoever it be; and all that which hath hindred you, and doth hinder from the Life and Virtue of it in your own Hearts; this all to leave behind you forever, and to give it away freely, and as freely willing as a man would part with Droſs for Gold, and preſent mortal Honour for immortal Renown forever; for behold, the Glory of the World paſſeth away, and all the Beauty thereof ſhall be as a fading Flower when it is fully ripe, the ſtrength thereof ſhall melt away like Wax before the Jealouſie of our God; and <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſhall be judged, and <hi>Babylon</hi> confounded, and the ſtrength of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor brought down; and the Lord will weaken the power of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and all the Earth ſhall know, that he is the ſame God of Power and righteous Judgments as ever, in the day when he cometh in the dread of his Power to aſſemble the <hi>Heathen</hi> to Judgment, and to pour forth Floods of Indignation
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66375:195"/> upon the Wicked, when Anguiſh ſhall enter the dwellings of the Ungodly, and intolerable perplexity ſeize upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Unfaithful; when the Hypocrite ſhall no longer cover himſelf, nor the Adverſaries of <hi>Sion</hi> rejoyce againſt her! when the Lord ſhall reach forth his Hand and ſcatter his open Enemies, as in the day of ſlaughter, and conſume the Bryars of the Earth, as with endleſs Burnings and unquenchable Flames in the ſtrength of his Fury, when he pleadeth by the Fire of his Jealouſie and the Sword of his Mouth, with all the Wicked, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and Unfaithful ones, who make Fleſh their Arm, and depart from the Word of the living God in their Hearts, which then they ſhall know to be Powerful againſt all Unrighteouſneſs, and quick in executing Judgments accordingly.</p>
            <p>Oh! happy is the Man that then ſhall know a Refuge, and bleſſed ſhall the People be whoſe God is then the Lord, and full well will it be for them who then know a hiding place! Then ſhall <hi>Sion</hi> alone rejoyce, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be glad forever, and only the redeemed of the Lord ſhall walk in the Paths of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in the midſt of devouring and conſuming Fire, which to them ſhall be as a Wall for everlaſting defence round about them, and as precious healing Oyl of Joy and Gladneſs in the midſt, and as pure Oyntment poured out into the Wounds of the broken-hearted! Light ſhall ſhine forever in their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Wiſdom ſhall be found in them, like as in <hi>Daniel</hi> the Servant of God in the dayes of Old, and only the Faithful ſhall ſtand, and the Upright-hearted ſhall endure, and God will keep his little Ones, and the Weak ſhall be ſtrengthened by him, and the Poor of the Flock ſhall be comforted; and the Feeble among men shall receive ſtrength from God as the Morning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of virtue as the dawning of the day, and the Lambs of the Fold shall be kept, and only Gods People shall ſtand; yea, they shall ſtand, and the Gates of Hell, with all the powers of darkneſs, shall never prevail againſt them; the Lord hath ſpoken it; whoſe Words shall ſtand forever, which shall ſeal it unto the Heritage of God, and the Droſs muſt be purged away, and the Unbelieving muſt ſtand behind; and the Careleſs will ſtagger at the Promiſes; and they that ſeek themſelves shall have Self enough; but Self shall never help them in that day, neither

            <p>And this moreover I ſay to every, particularly unto you who were late aſtray from God, and lately were convinced of the precious Truth of his Son, that in the Name and Power of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth from him to you was I ſent, and that more chiefly to gather the Out-caſts, than to feed the Lambs, who were already gathered; and rather to call home the loſt Sheep, than to nouriſh them that were already brought home, and to call Sinners to Repentance, and for the opening the Hearts, Underſtanding and Eyes of thoſe, who though they truly deſired, had not clearly underſtood the ſecret things of the hidden Wiſdom of the Almighty: And truly, my Love was to Sinners, and the true affections and breathing of my Soul for the Prodigals in them parts, which were moſt chiefly my Meſſage from God at that time, and my Service of Love unto the Souls of ſuch in them parts, and to publiſh the Name of the Almighty in the great Congregations; and ſurely my own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, even the gathered Flock of God, attended in much patience, whilſt I thus performed my Service of love to you; neither did I turn my Face from you to them, nor with-held from you the Counſel of God in truth; neither was I negligent in the Service to do you good; neither yet ſparing of my ſtrength, nor with-holding my Speech, when God gave utterance; but rather can truly ſay, I could even have been ſpent for you, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my Conſcience to the Lord my ſtrength.</p>
            <p>And now, this is that which my Heart deſireth of you, and my Soul deſireth for you, That you all, and every of whoſe Hearts then God touched with the feeling of his Love, by the power of his Immortal Word, through me his weak Earthen Veſſel, that you all may obey the Call and Viſitation of God in the requiring of his Light in your own Hearts, thereby wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to depart from the wayes of the Wicked, the profeſſions of the Hypocrites, and the paths of Ungodly men, and to ſtand
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66375:196"/> no long in the way of Sinners, nor regard the counſel of them who hate the Light and Truth in the inward parts, and to come out from amongſt them that are unclean, who live ſtill more and more in that which pollutes them, who live in their Sins, profeſſing God and ſerving the Devil, until they have finiſhed their Sins, which then bringeth forth Death; and he that dyeth in his Sins, not believing in the Light, which makes an end of ſin, cannot come where Chriſt is. And ſo, the Tree falling, there it lieth; and <hi>as Death leaveth, Judgment findeth; and as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment findeth, ſo ſhall the Reward according to the deeds be.</hi> And then ſhall every man ſtand or fall to his own Maſter; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Devil to their Maſter, and the Servants of God to their Maſter; and there is no more Maſters but them two, and no man can ſerve both, though Thouſands profeſs the one and ſerve the other, who in that day muſt give an account whom they have ſerved, and not whom they have profeſſed; for they who profeſſed God, and ſerved the Devil, were Hypocrites; and ſo are unto this day, of whom the World is full. And bleſſed are they who by the living Power of the Soul-ſaving Grace of God, are truly redeemed out of the way, works, worſhips and nature of ſuch, to ſerve the living God in the newneſs of the ſpirit, through Faith and Patience, and to walk in Innocency before the Lord for evermore. Such ſhall come to rejoyce in the Truth, and the Arm of the Lord ſhall bring them more nearer to himſelf, that they may come to ſee the Lord in his Glory, and to praiſe him in the Land of the living, and to behold <hi>Sion</hi> in her perfect Beauty, and to feel their Unity with Gods Elect, and to enjoy the Covenant of Everlaſting Peace, that ſhall never be broken, to be bound up together in the life of Immortality, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, to ſhine forth as the Morning, like the Jewels of the Lamb, and to be beautified with Meekneſs as the Members of the unſpotted of God.</p>
            <p>Oh! the Crown of Rejoycing and Everlaſting Felicity that is ſet before you, to whom I am not able to expreſs the infinite bounty and goodneſs of the Almighty! Oh! who can hold when the Lord hath ſpoken, or conceal his loving-kindneſs, when the Almighty giveth utterance? The Lord hath enlarged my Heart, let me not therefore enquire among you, where
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66375:196"/> there is room to receive it! Oh! let there be an inward ſearch, whether that the door be open, and the ſtraitneſs taken away, that he which was with you may find entrance in you, and you truly come to feel the receiving of his life, to the glad Tidings of your Hearts. From ſuch an outward Priſon cannot keep me, nor from them the vaſt diſtance of Miles cannot with-hold me! Behold, I ſay, in the Name of God, I am near unto you.</p>
            <p>And when you are aſſembled together with one accord, in the place where the <hi>Light</hi> is a Miniſtry to the work, this read among you in the fear of the God of Heaven; then ſhall many of you know it ſo to be, &amp; that the Lord hath given me of his unlimited Spirit, which I freely let forth unto you: And the breathings of my life are, that you might receive benefit thereby, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted together. And be ſtrengthened in the inward man, that the Devil may not prevail, nor the love of the World overcome the innocent deſires which God hath begotten; let no unbelief nor ſlaviſh fear hinder you in your ſpiritual progreſs toward the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Crown of Life in the Kingdom of bleſſedneſs, which God hath certainly prepared for the upright and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>And now, behold, I turn unto my Brethren, the called and choſen of God, whom my Soul hereby ſaluteth, unto whom I cannot by words ſufficiently expreſs my <hi>Love,</hi> neither have I room to publiſh the enlargedneſs thereof in writing, neither will uſual phraſes of Speech ſatisfie my broken Heart. Oh! bleſſed be the day that ever you were called, and the hour of your Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, and the time of the Conception of the Seed in the Womb, and the ſeaſon of the forth-coming thereof into the liberty of Peace! Bleſſed be the Lord forever on your behalf, who hath choſen you to the riches of life, and brought you to the Well-ſprings of Mercy, and cauſed you to drink of the Rivers of his ſtrength, which hath daily been renewed unto you, Oh! bleſſed be the God whoſe love hath not been with-held from your Souls, and who hath not with-held counſel from your Eyes!</p>
            <p>Friends, God hath opened my Heart unto you, receive me therefore as in the Bowels of Mercy, that now we may praiſe the Lord forever: Oh! that your Souls may with me forever
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66375:197"/> magnifie the unutterable Power of the God of Heaven, and that you may this day with me drink freely of the Cup of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that then we may reſt together as in a Bed of Repoſe, in the delightſom Arms of our Father's love, that forever we may ſing the Song of the Lamb, and ſound forth the Praiſes of the Almighty together, that you may know the Lord is with me, and that the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is indeed become my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Support. And unto you all, Friends, Erethren and fellow Members of the heavenly Body, theſe are the pourings forth of Gods infinite Love, free for all that can receive it.</p>
            <p>And thus in few words as unto you, my Brethren, even deſiring to be felt and received in that which comprehendeth all words, and is more than words can expreſs, in which the words end, which was before the words were, where my dwelling is; and you that truly know me, know it ſo to be, where-with you in the eternal Beeing and Subſtance of all living, I reſt in the Fountain of Mercy, deſiring daily, in my pourings forth of my Soul unto God, that you all may walk blameleſly, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Truth of your Hearts, to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the day of Tryal at hand. And ſo in the power of Wiſdom, which is the Refuge of the Innocent, the Lord God Almighty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth preſerve you all, and keep you all for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>Concerning TYTHES.</head>
            <p>TYthes at firſt were not required, but given only of the Spoils of the War (only once) by <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto him that was made like unto the Son; but the Subſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come (even Chriſt) who was before the Wars, and before <hi>Abraham,</hi> he redeems out of the Luſt, from whence the Wars ariſe; and ſo bringeth to an end of that from whence Wars come, and ſo to an End of that from whence <hi>Tythes</hi> were firſt given, and ſo to give nor pay Tythes any longer, being redeemed out of Luſt, and Wars, and Fightings, by the Blood of Jeſus, who ſaid, <hi>I am the Light, that abideth a Prieſt forever;</hi> and his day <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> rejoyced to ſee, who brings to the End of the Tythes, and makes War with that, and ſlayes that, which cauſed men to Slay one another in the Wars, who comes to ſave the Life, who is Greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> who being now come, denyeth fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaith, <hi>He that taketh the Sword, ſhall periſh with the Sword:</hi> And ſo that was to periſh whereby Tythes were firſt given; then muſt there needs be an end of Tythes, which alſo periſheth with the uſing, and the Law for the Tythes (<hi>which had a ſhadow of good things to come</hi>) decayes and waxes old, and vaniſheth away, the good things themſelves being come, and good will towards man, and the Covenant of Light to joyn the hearts together. For Tythes were never given nor paid until after men had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſlain, and done violence and wrong one to another; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Love your Enemies; and if he ſmite thee on the one Cheek, turn the other:</hi> And ſuch as are come to that, and obey his command, are come out of the Wars and the Strife unto the Prince of Peace who was before the Wars, and ſo know the peaceable Covenant, which will not wax old, but laſt forever, in which there is no Wars nor killing one another, and ſo comes to the End of that Covenant, which commanded the Tythes, and to the change of the Law, the Prieſt whereof; and they that receive the Tythes, murder and ſlay him that is to bring to the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66375:198"/> End of Tythes; ſo that by him to the End of Tythes they are not come, nor from under the firſt Covenant, where the Tythes are paid whilſt the vail is over the Heart, and that Miniſtry ſtanding, which makes nothing Perfect, and will dye, and change, and periſh, but he that Redeems out of and from among them, and that which periſheth, <hi>abides a Prieſt forever:</hi> and of him it is ſaid, <hi>he liveth.</hi> And ſo him we bear Teſtimony of, who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within the Vail, in whom the Vail is done away, and ſo that is ſeen, and departed from, and made an end of, which ſtood whilſt the Vail was not rent, and the way into a more Holy known than the firſt Covenant, wherein the Tythes were paid, the Vail being over the Heart, and is yet over the Hearts of all them who pay or receive Tythes, and all that uphold it; who may take notice, that the firſt Prieſts that ever took by force Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, were Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and <hi>knew not God,</hi> whom the Lord deſtroy'd, and they periſhed in the Wars with the Sword, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 12. ver.</hi> 16. Therefore we cannot but deny Tythes, and the upholding of it, and all ſuch as take it (eſpecially) <hi>ly force,</hi> which Actions are the fruits of ſuch <hi>Prieſts as know not</hi> God, and ſuch he will overturn. For the Seed of God in many Thouſands, Cryes unto him, by reaſon of the <hi>Cruel Oppreſſion</hi> of <hi>Tythes,</hi> from under which the Lord will deliver us.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe God of Heaven, that made me, and the Lord God of Power that called me to obey and follow him, even in that day when I was not acquainted with his Voice, and who hath been my Guide, Defence, Succour and Comfort unto this day and moment, and who hath ever upheld me, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Child by the Arm of his Power, whom the world neither did nor can by its Wiſdom ever know, who is the only wiſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:66375:198"/> Spirit that upholdeth all things by the Word of his Power, who is dreadful to the <hi>Heathen</hi> that know him not, and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than ever can be expreſſed with Tongue or Pen, unto them who have felt and received and live in the true ſence of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging incomes of the virtue of his Power, the Life whereof to them is moſt deſirable. My Strength, Life and Refuge alone is he, whoſe ſervice I have no cauſe to decline, and whoſe precious powerfull call he never gave me cauſe to repent; for with himſelf he hath and doth dayly gratify me with a full Reward for all, and all manner of my manifold Tryals, and daily Sufferings, and Exerciſes, which I meet with in the way, but really and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely I can truly ſay, that none of theſe things move me in the leaſt from that foundation, upon which the God of Heaven and Earth hath long ſince eſtabliſhed me, that I might ſtand for him and the Glory of his Name, who hath both ſet and appointed me thereunto, and given me Courage, as a fortified Tower, to ſtand as a mark for the Adverſaries of <hi>Sion</hi> to vent forth the utmoſt of their limited Fury. And in the Lord my ſtrength is my Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, neither have I believed that ever I ſhould diſtruſt him, though ſince the day that I have known him he hath even ſuffered the Sorrows of Death, and the pangs of Hell, and the Powers of Unutterable Darkneſs at ſometimes to compaſs me in on every ſide, and to lift up themſelves in the vaunting Arrogancy of the ſwelling Pride thereof, as Mountains never to be removed. But behold, he who hath his way in the Whirl-wind, and his path through the midſt of the deepeſt Ocan, him alone it was that my broken Heart was by the power of his conſtraining Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow forever, even through the greateſt difficulties, and the moſt hardeſt Straits, Tryals and Hardſhips, with all manner of outward and inward Sufferings, that might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to happen unto or fall upon any one of the Children of men. Oh! that I could now ſufficiently declare his Goodneſs, and ſo fully and effectually make mention of his Power, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth! or as the Lord hath given into my Heart to deſire of him to be made uſe of, in the Declaration or Manifeſtation thereof in this my day, unto the Sons and Children of men. Surely, when I am waiting of him, and of his unutterable Goodneſs and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, my Words and Lines are alſo ſhort of ſetting forth, the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66375:199"/> Virtue and Fullneſs of the moſt unexpreſſible divine excellency thereof, that ſometimes I am rather ready to dwell in ſilence with and in the fullneſs thereof, which overcomes with unutterable Virtue, than to be writing of that which in its ſelf can never be written, though what is written may be by and with, and from the overflowings of the ſame, and ſo be as drops or little ſtreams of heavenly Water, to refreſh the dry and thirſty Land, which therein doth its ſervice, and then the praiſe thereof is to return unto him who is the alone fountain of all Virtue, and the Life which giveth Life, even unto the dead that hear his Voice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he comes to be known to be <hi>Infinite</hi> in Wiſdom, Power and Virtue, whom my ſoul doth Honour, my heart doth Praiſe, and my ſpirit adoreth forever; for none is like to him, neither doth my ſoul deſire any other but he whilſt in this body, or for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in the Life which yet doth come.</p>
            <p>Let all that know him bow before him, and let all that hear his voice be humble and meek, and let every one that truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him wait with diligence and in patience upon him, and let all that are faithful to him rejoyce in his Love, and prize him for much more then the liberty of their bodies, or the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Thouſands and Thouſands of Thouſands of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Viſible Earthly thing, All which are his, and he is ours, yea, he is certainly mine, and I am his, and my ſoul doth mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him, and my ſpirit doth yet breath farther to ſound forth his Praiſes, not only all the dayes of my life, whilſt in this Earthly Tabernacle, but likewiſe in the hearts of Thouſands of them yet unborn, and among the Generations that are yet to come by my faithful upright Teſtimony, and the Record thereof, which may remain, when the God and Father of my life hath gathered me, with the reſt of his ſervants of old to live with him, in the delightſom Ocean of the Infinite Fullneſs of his moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Power and precious Preſence, the ſtreams whereof already are as the free Iſſuings forth of Life Eternal, and as the ſtreams of Mercy, and the dews of the Morning Refreſhing, even the outmoſt borders of my dwelling, and Comforting the mournful places of my Habitation!
